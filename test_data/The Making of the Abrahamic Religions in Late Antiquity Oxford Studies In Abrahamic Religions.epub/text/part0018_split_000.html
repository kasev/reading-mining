<p class="parafl">We have seen in <a href="part0017_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7" class="calibre3">Chapter 6</a> how late antique Jewish and Christian communities developed conflicting relations and how these two monotheistic religions drew vastly different conclusions from the idea of the one God, creator and ruler of the universe. We shall presently analyze some of the implications of the law and the rule of God.</p>
<p class="para">The relationship between religious authority and political power is a major problem in all societies. As the question is framed differently in each cultural and historical context, the solutions represent a very broad spectrum. Since the Enlightenment, “theocracy” is often used—pejoratively—in order to refer to those political regimes where an established religion plays a central role. This is, however, a rather vague use of the term which, historically, refers only to the direct rule of the one God in the society that obeys his Law. In other words, “theocracy” strictly understood only refers to societies established upon a monotheistic religion. In other cases, for instance, in the polytheistic societies of the ancient Near East, one should speak of “sacred kingship” rather than of theocracy.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-1" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Now, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam obviously share some significant features, or what Wittgenstein called “family resemblances,” both from a historical and from a structural viewpoint. At the same time, the three main Abrahamic religions reflect strikingly different historical and cultural experiences. Moreover, each of these religions has also undergone, throughout its history, a number of radical transformations which render any hypostatic approach highly problematic. The similarities are sometimes greater between Judaism and Christianity (such as the Hebrew Bible), or between Judaism and Islam (such as the centrality of legal aspects of religion), or else between Christianity and Islam (such as the cardinal role of the relationship between religious and political authority). The relationship between religious authority <span id="page_124"></span>and political power is framed very differently in each of the three Abrahamic religions.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-2" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> “Theocracy,” indeed, means different things in the various Jewish, Christian, and Islamic contexts throughout history. This chapter will focus on the late antique formative period of the Abrahamic religions and seek to shed some light on the relationship between religious and political authority in the late antique world, in particular around the birth of Islam.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-3" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a></p>
