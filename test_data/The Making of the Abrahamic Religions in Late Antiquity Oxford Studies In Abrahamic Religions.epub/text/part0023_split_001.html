<p class="parafl">Patristic texts have been scanned, of course, for their references to pagan myths, beliefs, and rituals. From Clement of Alexandria, through figures such as Lactantius, Firmicus Maternus or Arnobius of Sicca, to Sozomen, and beyond, patristic literature remains one of our most important sources for the study of late antique paganism. In a variety of ways, as a byproduct of their virulent polemics, as it were, some of the patristic writers offer valuable insights on religious attitudes in the world of their contemporaries and on some central pagan myths and rituals. Clement, in particular, who was born a pagan in second-century Alexandria, is an unequaled source of information on various aspects of pagan religion and especially on the Greek mysteries, as well as on late Egyptian religion. What is even more remarkable, however, is his full-fledged conception of the history of religions, from the earliest antiquity—and not only of the “history of salvation,” or <i class="calibre1">Heilsgeschichte</i>, and <span id="page_190"></span>the history of Israel.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-2" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> Clement shows a remarkable consciousness of Christianity inscribing itself within the general history of religions. By far the most interesting feature of the <i class="calibre1">Protrepticus</i> from our perspective is Clement’s concise history of religion in seven stages of paganism, though these are not necessarily chronologically consecutive.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-3" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a> This highly original conception would in itself have been enough to offer Clement a place among the best historians and observers of religion in the ancient world, together with Herodotus and his contemporary Lucian.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-4" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> In the sixth book of the <i class="calibre1">Stromateis</i>, Clement develops at length the theme of Greek borrowing from the Egyptians and also from the Indians. Doing so, he devotes much attention to Indian religion, and is the first author in Greek literature to refer to Buddhism.</p>
<p class="para">Recent scholarship has highlighted the fact that monotheistic belief was not restricted to Jews and Christians in the Roman Empire. Pagan monotheism (the locution sounds like an oxymoron) was in fact a rather widespread phenomenon in the early centuries of the Christian era.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-5" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> It is now becoming clearer that the traditional picture of the passage from paganism to Christianity,” as a transition from polytheism to monotheism is a rather simplistic one. For many pagan intellectuals under the early Empire—and not only philosophers—as well as for a number of religious trends, the idea of a single supreme divine power was a natural one. This does not mean, of course, that there was no major difference regarding the nature of the Divinity between such views and those of Christians. The God of Plotinus is not quite that of Origen. The fundamental differences between pagan and Christian conceptions must be sought elsewhere than in the abstract idea of monotheism.</p>
<p class="para">Significant as it may be, however, scholarly focus on “pagans and Christians” may be deeply misleading as we seek to understand the religious milieu of early Christianity better. Such an approach tends to distort the perceived proportions of this environment, where enemies much closer than the pagans were prominent. Both the Jews and a number of sectarians, in particular <span id="page_191"></span>dualists, offered much more serious challenges than the pagans to the emerging “party line,” or orthodoxy, than the “atheist” pagans. Traditional historiography usually deals with polemics against Jews, Gnostics, Manichaeans, and pagans in so many different frameworks, while the emergence of Islam, at the very end of the patristic period, is often simply ignored. Hence, in order to understand fully the contribution of patristic literature to the history of religions in late antiquity, one must study <i class="calibre1">together</i> the challenges offered by heretics, Jews, and pagans.</p>
