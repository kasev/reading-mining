<h1 class="h" id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-titleGroup-8"><span class="title1"><span>I</span></span></h1><p class="parafl">The present book deals with some critical aspects of religion in late antiquity, particularly in the Near East, from the beginnings of Christianity to the birth of Islam. As is well known, the Islamic conquests represented nothing less than a religious revolution throughout the Near East. In particular, they transformed Christian self-understanding in the East, on both sides of the border between Byzantium and the Caliphate. In the West too, the consciousness of the new, powerful challenge to the Christian empire never remained very far. Hence, the advent of Islam constitutes the first real challenge to the belief in the ecumenical destiny of Christianity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-1" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In any study of religion in late antiquity, Christianity will obviously play a major role. While the trajectory of ancient Christianity is usually studied by church historians, it may be worthwhile to approach it also from the outside, taking into consideration its religious <i class="calibre1">Umwelt</i> and its broader context, in order to identify differences as well as similarities and parallel phenomena. Sasanian Zoroastrianism, rabbinic Judaism, ancient Christianity, Greco-Roman religion under the Empire, the so-called Oriental religions, or pre-Islamic Arab paganism, are all usually treated as clearly distinct historical traditions, to be studied independently of one another. Officially hailed, inter-disciplinarity remains too often shunned in practice.</p>
<p class="para">The rationale for maintaining the traditional disciplinary boundaries is as obvious as its price is high. If we agree that a number of different religious identities interact in late antiquity, refusing to study them together prevents us from understanding the main vectors of religious innovation and more specifically the deep causes explaining the advent of Islam. We should seek, <span id="page_2"></span>therefore, to discover the rules of a transformative grammar which could explain patterns of religious transformation. This is obviously not an easy task, but giving up without even trying condemns us to counting trees rather than delineating the forest’s contours.</p>
<p class="para">The Islamicist Patricia Crone’s latest, magisterial book, <i class="calibre1">The Nativist Prophets of Early Islamic Iran: Rural Revolt and Local Zoroastrianism</i><a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-2" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> offers a striking example of the riches to be discovered by daring to cross disciplinary boundaries. Even when dealing with documents not central to her quest, such as the Gnostic, early Christian and Jewish-Christian texts, Crone demonstrates the fruitfulness of her method. She works upstream as well as downstream of the <i class="calibre1">hijra</i>, in order to detect the deep roots of various myths, theologoumena, or rituals and the early manifestations of later developments. These often survived for centuries, more or less underground, in order to reappear in significantly different cultural and religious contexts.</p>
<p class="para">We have learned to recognize the centrality of religion in forging new identities in late antiquity. Ethnos or culture (in particular, language) had been more obvious formative elements of identity than religion in the classical and Hellenistic worlds. For a very long time, and until recently, the main paradigm for describing the dramatic religious changes of late antiquity was essentially the passage from paganism to Christianity, or from polytheism to monotheism. In the last generation, there is a better appreciation of these complex transformations, which may amount to what one can call a religious mutation.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-3" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The continued importance of Judaism in its competition with Christianity, the major impact of dualistic movements, and nascent Islam as a phenomenon of late antiquity, all these have weakened the traditional paradigm, although a new one has yet to emerge. Efforts should be made, imperfect and tentative as they may be, to analyze the complex dynamics of religious change in late antiquity from the perspective of a unified history of religion.</p>
<p class="para">To borrow the categories famously invented by the American linguist and anthropologist Kenneth Lee Pike, I propose to reflect here from an etic rather than an emic viewpoint. Although I have made many efforts, over decades, in order to understand better the religious and intellectual worlds of early Christianity, I have done that not as a church historian or a patristic scholar, but as a comparative historian of religion in late antiquity. In my research, <span id="page_3"></span>I have focused mainly upon the contacts of Christians with Jews and pagans, as well as upon the formation and development of those internal challenges which the church fathers (the intellectuals of the winning party) called “the heresies,” in particular Gnosticism and Manichaeism.</p>
<p class="para">As is well known, the Constantinian revolution usually remains, together with its sequels throughout the fourth century, the obvious and unavoidable turning point of any ancient Christian historiography. To be sure, one might ask whether this traditional narrative is really compelling. From a despised and forbidden minority religion, Christianity moved very fast, from Constantine’s days on, to the status of a legitimate religion and then to that of the imperial official religion. While Judaism would remain tolerated in the Christian Roman Empire, all public forms of paganism—and in particular animal sacrifices—were forbidden by law after the publication of the Thessaloniki edict (<i class="calibre1">Cunctos Populos</i>) in 380. For the theologian and sociologist of religion Ernst Troeltsch, the first chapter in church history, which ended in the fourth century, represented the passage from sect to church. For his friend Max Weber, this transformation represented the passage from a charismatic to a routinized religion. To a great extent, such conceptions still inform much of contemporary historiography of ancient Christianity.</p>
<p class="para">Hence, the traditional vision of the religious context of ancient Christianity is constituted by both its Jewish matrix, mainly until the so-called “parting of the ways” in the first half of the second century, and Roman paganism thereafter, until the fourth century.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-4" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> After the fourth-century watershed, Christian historiography usually functioned in an autarkic way, with other religions relegated to a dark, indistinct background about which there is little to say, or at least little to say that directly impinges on church history.</p>
<p class="para">I shall seek here to offer another approach to ancient Christianity in its multiple religious milieus, by taking the long view, from the birth of Christianity to that of Islam. In that sense, I am aware that I am overly stretching the limits of late antiquity. But, the deep causes for paradigm shifts in religion can only be discerned in the very long run. A view from the Near East offers a perspective different from that of traditional historiography. It shows, rather than the transformation of a Jewish sect into the triumphant Catholic Church, that of a forbidden sect in the Roman Empire into a tolerated one under the Caliphate. Both in those areas that had been part of the Sasanian Empire and in those that had belonged to Byzantium, the Christian communities would become, in the Islamic realm, tolerated minorities—together with the Jews and the Zoroastrians. One can say that the Christians had now reverted, to some extent, to the sociological status of their sectarian beginnings, although not <span id="page_4"></span>quite. Christians had achieved under the Muslims an official recognition as a tolerated religious community possessing a prophetic scripture (<i class="calibre1">ahl al-kitāb</i>). Hence, Christians were members of a tolerated religion, although they were required to pay a special tax (<i class="calibre1">ahl al-dhimma</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-5" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> In that sense, one can trace a trajectory of ancient Christianity which leads it from Qumran to Qur’an.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-6" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">For the comparative historian of religion, the Near East and the whole Mediterranean, from the first to the seventh century, constitute a rare laboratory where a number of religious communities were in constant contact and conflict.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-7" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> Rather than referring to “sects,” a quite loaded word alluding to doctrines deviant from the reigning orthodoxy, we should perhaps speak of communities. These communities were connected through a highly complex web which offered a kaleidoscope of sorts, in which the various crystals constantly restructured themselves in a seemingly infinite number of new structures.</p>
<p class="para">Beyond the many differences between the various worldviews, a religious <i class="calibre1">koinē</i> of sorts can be discerned in the Roman Empire and beyond: the numerous religious communities might well have been constantly fighting one another. Yet, they shared a number of presuppositions (usually implicit rather than explicit) that constituted the structures of their religious world.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-8" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> These structures evolved with time, although the consciousness of this evolution was not always clear.</p>
<p class="para">While the Roman world in which the new religion grew and blossomed could be aptly described by Cicero as “a world full of gods,” it is important to remember that these gods were not only the Roman gods.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-9" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> The rich religious context of ancient Christianity included, besides Judaism and Roman religion, and not only in the East, a number of Oriental cults from Asia and Egypt (such as Isis, Cybele, or Mithras), and various Gnostic trends, such as Hermeticism, Manichaeism, Mandaeism, and Zoroastrianism. In the late antique Mediterranean and the Near East, the varieties of religious experience and modes of religiosity reflect the interface between a number of cultures and civilizations.</p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_5"></span>The Jewish world in which Christianity was born can certainly be defined as a sectarian milieu. Side by side with the Pharisees and the Essenes, Flavius Josephus names the “party” (<i class="calibre1">hairesis</i>) of the elite—the Sadducees—and that of the partisans of radical revolt against Rome—the Zealots—in the spectrum of Palestinian Jewry.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-10" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> The community of Jewish sectarians in Qumran, on the north-western shores of the Dead Sea, was destroyed by the Romans during the Jewish war in the first century. As is well known, many of the sectarians’ writings were found after the Second World War, a fact which permits us to get a glimpse of their beliefs and rituals. While the specialists still argue vehemently over the exact identity of the Qumran covenanters, it stands to reason to assume that they were Essenes, or close to the Essenes, and that there were some striking similarities between their religious world and that of John the Baptist. For all practical purposes, Jesus himself seems to have had some sympathy for aspects of the Essenes’ religious attitude (in particular in his eschatological expectations and his social sensitivity), while in other ways he was probably very close to the Pharisees (a fact which also explains the anti-Pharisee polemics in the Gospels).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-11" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Among the first followers of Jesus, who were of course all Jewish, not all gave up, with Paul, on the traditional Jewish patterns of behavior. Those Jews who believed that the Messiah had come, but who refused to give up on Jewish religious law are traditionally referred to in scholarship as “Jewish-Christians.” Ebionites (from Hebrew <i class="calibre1">evyon</i>, poor), is only one of the various names of the sect. Both the church fathers and the rabbis sought to minimalize their presence and to argue that the sect had fundamentally disappeared by the fourth century.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-12" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> Yet, we know from a number of testimonies that the Ebionites were still present, even if marginally from a sociological viewpoint, in the seventh century. I mean to call attention to the surprising continuity of sectarian milieus, in relation to which I propose to look at the development of Christianity in antiquity.</p>
<p class="para">For the traditional narrative, reflecting Patristic perceptions, the sectarian milieu of the Christian beginnings would soon be absorbed into the new structures created in the inhabited world, the <i class="calibre1">oikoumenē</i>, by victorious Christianity. The Ebionites, like the various Gnostic groups, would have disappeared, for all practical purposes, by the fourth century. Of all the numerous sects traditionally refered to as “Gnostic,” only the Manichaeans, who had <span id="page_6"></span>established a real ecumenical church like the Christians themselves, would remain a real, powerful threat to Catholic Christianity.</p>
<p class="para">Such a view, however, does not really reflect reality on the ground. A number of indices reveal the traces of various sects even in very late times. Hence, the Jewish-Christians do not seem to have really disappeared. Even if these sects seem to have been of little significance from a sociological viewpoint, the important fact is that we can now assume with real confidence that some marginal Jewish-Christian communities remained active in the Near East, in particular in various areas of Palestine, Syria, and Arabia throughout late antiquity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-13" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">This rich religious mosaic remained that of the Near East, within and without the borders of the Roman Empire, until at least the seventh century. In this regard, the Arabist John Wansbrough has been able to speak about the “sectarian milieu” within which Islam was born, thinking not only about Arabian Hijaz, but, more broadly, about greater Syria (the Arabic <i class="calibre1">Bilad al-Shām</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-14" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> This “sectarian milieu” included not only Christians and Jews, but also a number of religious communities on the margins of the leading traditions.</p>
<p class="para">The religious world in which Christianity developed, from its beginnings and throughout late antiquity, remained pluralistic by nature. I am not arguing, of course, that Constantine and his successors did not transform the status of Christianity in the Empire. What I am saying, rather, is that a continuous thread links, nonetheless, Christian discourse from the origins to the eve of the medieval age. In that sense, the fourth century, despite its undeniable significance, does not constitute in the East a radical game changer, as the history of the Christian communities there cannot be understood in isolation from that of other religious communities. Constant interface entailed a dialectics of reciprocal impact between the different religious identities—identities characterized by their fluidity. One could speak here of intertwined or connected histories—to use a term coined by the historian of early modern India Sanjay Subrahmanyam—of an essentially plural history of religion.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-15" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">If the birth of Islam constitutes a religious revolution, comparable, <i class="calibre1">mutatis mutandis</i>, to the birth of Christianity, we should be able to reconstitute the vector leading from one to the other. A religious revolution entails a paradigm change: various elements that were expressed by a number of religious agents suddenly coalesce and their sum creates a new reality. Since Thomas Kuhn’s <span id="page_7"></span>seminal book on scientific revolutions, historians and philosophers of science have learned that the paradigm changes reflected in scientific revolutions do not appear <i class="calibre1">ex nihilo</i>, but rather are prepared by a number of smaller-scale changes effected by various agents. We should perhaps learn to approach religious revolutions in a similar way.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-16" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">I propose to call the religious transformations of late antiquity a <i class="calibre1">praeparatio coranica</i>, referring metaphorically to “The Evangelical Preparation” (<i class="calibre1">Praeparatio Evangelica</i>), the title of Eusebius of Caesarea’s book on pagan pre-Christian Greek ideas, as having prepared, in a sense, the development of Christian concepts. This expression highlights the dramatic pace with which the new Islamic realm succeeded not only in conquering lands throughout the Near East, but also in converting populations (mainly, but not only, Christian).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-17" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a> This pace is not really explainable without taking into account the fact that some of the main traits of the Qur’an’s message had not only been circulating for centuries, but to some extent had been internalized, becoming part of the religious and ethical ethos of late antique Christianity (and also Judaism). Prophecy, eschatological expectations, asceticism, fear of sin were all part and parcel of the late antique religious <i class="calibre1">koinē</i>.</p>
<p class="para">What we have recently learned to call “the Abrahamic religions”, which one referred to earlier as “the religions of the book” or the “monotheistic religions,” are usually conceived as referring to, at least, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (the term itself is a modern plural rooted in the Qur’anic expression about <i class="calibre1">dīn Ibrāhīm</i>, “the religion [singular] of Abraham”). Although its emergence seems to be linked to contemporary efforts, mainly in Western Europe, to accept fast-growing Muslim minorities, it is rather convenient for referring to what one used to call “the monotheistic religions,” as it highlights the genetic link between these families of religions.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-18" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_8"></span>Actually, we should realize that in order to speak about “the Abrahamic religions,” a plurality of two is enough. Indeed, Christian competition with Judaism in the first centuries is clearly modeled on Abraham’s true inheritance, as a number of texts, from Justin Martyr to Eusebius of Caesarea, show. In many ways, emergent Islam reduplicated the model developed earlier by the Christians. The Christians considered themselves, from the first century on, to be the true sons and legitimate inheritors of Abraham, while the Jews had turned away from the core message of the forefather. Similarly, the Qur’an applied also to Christians the logic of the latter’s argument against the Jews: both Jews and Christians have perverted the deep kernel of the true religion of Abraham, which the Qur’an reclaims.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-19" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In many ways, one can hence conceive late antiquity as being the true crucible of the Abrahamic religions: it is in the polemics between Jews and Christians and in the Christian attitudes to a number of crucial religious problems that the conceptions that would soon become identified with Islam were forged. The emergence, mainly among Christians, but also among Jews, Zoroastrians, and dualists, of modes of thought that would be instrumental in permitting the rise of Islam, represents the <i class="calibre1">praeparatio coranica</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-20" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">To some extent, the common perception of the Constantinian revolution may lead to a slanted understanding of the Christianization process in the Roman Empire. From J. B. Bury to Paul Veyne, a whole tradition of historiography insists on the imperial <i class="calibre1">fiat</i> which made Christianity into a <i class="calibre1">religio licita</i>, soon to be the preferred one, and eventually the only legitimate state religion. To Veyne’s restatement of this approach in <i class="calibre1">Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien</i>, Marie-Françoise Baslez objected the following year, in a brilliant book, <i class="calibre1">Comment notre monde est devenu chrétien</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-21" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> Baslez describes how throughout the first three centuries, the Christian communities, originally close to the Qumran covenanters, gradually adopted different identities according to the various areas and cities of the Empire. She shows how, from the second to the fourth century, Christianity gradually became a religion of the book. For Baslez, explaining the Christianization of the Empire through a sudden and total conversion of Constantine remains unconvincing.</p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_9"></span>Despite this sobering approach, the leading paradigm in contemporary historiography of religion in late antiquity seems to remain that of the radical revolution. Following a recent fashion according to which <i class="calibre1">Ioudaismos</i> refers to geographical or ethnic, rather than religious identity, Daniel Boyarin, a scholar of rabbinic Judaism, has claimed that religion itself, as a concept, was invented in the fourth century <span class="sc">ce</span>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-22" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> Although Boyarin rightly detects a real mutation of the concept of religion in the fourth century, his claim is obviously quite odd, as if the Greeks, the Romans, or the Egyptians, had had only rituals, but no beliefs (I assume here that any definition of religion would include a mixture of words and deeds, of myths and rituals). For Boyarin, Constantine is thus in a sense the inventor of two religions, rabbinic Judaism side by side with Christianity. As in most far-fetched views, there is a kernel of truth in this vision of things. Namely, religion underwent, in the Roman Empire and throughout the Mediterranean, a series of major changes, which do amount to a radical transformation.</p>
<p class="para">The passage from paganism to Christianity, or from polytheism to monotheism, in late antiquity has been traditionally perceived as the major religious transformation of our period. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the important phenomenon of what is now commonly called “pagan monotheism” in late antiquity. It may be legitimate, therefore, to devote here some attention to what one can call the varieties of monotheism in late antiquity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-23" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a></p>
