<p class="parafl">According to traditional understanding, the Caliph (<i class="calibre1">khalīfa</i>, from the root <i class="calibre1">kh.l.f.,</i> to replace) was in the early Islamic realm the supreme leader of the community (<i class="calibre1">umma</i>), replacing the prophet Muhammad. This view of things was challenged by Patricia Crone and Martin Hinds, who argued in <i class="calibre1">God’s Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam</i>, convincingly to my mind, that in the early Muslim texts the Caliph was perceived as God’s deputy (<i class="calibre1">khalīfat Allāh fi-al-arḍ</i>), rather than following in Muhammad’s footsteps. <i class="calibre1">Khalifat Allāah</i> was the original title of the Umayyad head of state, rather than <i class="calibre1">khalīfat rasul Allāh</i> (“Deputy of God’s Apostle”), a title which makes its appearance under the Abbasids. Originally, then, the Caliph’s authority comes directly from God.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-14" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In her major synthetic study of Islamic political thought, Crone develops this thesis:</p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">
<span id="page_129"></span>an imam or caliph was a ruler who recognized all power as God’s and used it in accordance with His will, and government by such a person accorded with the wishes of his subjects, for all believers accepted God’s rule. By contrast, a king would treat his power as his private property…In short, <i class="calibre1">imama/khilafa</i> stood for theocracy, government by God, whereas <i class="calibre1">mulk</i> stood for autocracy, government by selfish, arbitrary, and shortsighted human beings.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-15" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre5">15</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="parafl">Crone notes that “the fusion (as opposed to blurring) of political and religious communities has not in fact been common in the history of complex societies at all.” Crone further notes in this context that “Like everyone else in the Middle East, the Arabs were affected by the Hellenistic concept of kings as endowed with a fullness of power,” adding that there was only one precedent to Muhammad’s all-purpose community: Moses.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-16" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a> We will come back to the figure of Moses in late antiquity. It points to a major factor: it is within the Judeo-Christian context, rather than by using the diffuse concept of “sacred kingship,” that we should search for the proximate channels for the formation of the early Islamic conception of the ideal ruler’s theological-political realm.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-17" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Suffice it to note, for our present purposes, that the political dimension of religion is much more straightforward in Islam than in either Judaism or Christianity. From the start, Muhammad’s community, the Islamic <i class="calibre1">umma,</i> is possessed at once of political and of religious dimensions. More precisely, spiritual and political leadership are to a great extent identical.</p>
<p class="para">Among the Abrahamic religions, only for the Islamic community does the union of theological and political power seem to represent the natural, or ideal, state of affairs. Now, as we saw in <a href="part0014_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5" class="calibre3">Chapter 4</a>, the early seventh century was a time of intense eschatological speculation among both Jews and Christians. One can argue, then, that to a certain extent Muhammad’s conception of the <i class="calibre1">umma</i>’s leadership reflects the eschatological perception of things. In a sense, Muhammad’s <i class="calibre1">umma</i> represents realized eschatology.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-18" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a></p>
