<p class="parafl">Justinian’s proclamation, in February 553, of his Novella 146, <i class="calibre1">peri Hebraiōn</i>, is very revealing here: on the pretext of a disagreement among the Jews over the legitimacy of the ritual reading of the Bible in translation in the synagogue cult, he decided to involve himself directly in the argument and ruling over <span id="page_184"></span>permitted and forbidden synagogue ritual.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-26" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a> He encouraged the Jews to read the Bible in their synagogues, not only in Hebrew, but also in translation, be it in Greek, Latin, or another vernacular (when in Greek, the only version authorized by the Novella is the LXX, which was inspired), and prohibited the study of the Mishnah (<i class="calibre1">deuterōsis</i>). Justinian’s famous ruling, which has been analyzed from a number of viewpoints, certainly reflects the Byzantines’ sense of cultural superiority, which made them scorn barbarian languages and ignore them. In this, they were the cultural heirs of the Greeks.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-27" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-27" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">27</sup></a> This scorn and ignorance they applied to the Élanguage of the revealed Bible.</p>
<p class="para">Thus, the Byzantine millennium did not, to my knowledge, produce a single Hebraist, no one like Jerome, defender of <i class="calibre1">hebraica veritas</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-28" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a> By encouraging the Jews to forgo the sole use of Hebrew in reading the Holy Scriptures, imperial power sought to deprive them of both their own identity and the major linguistic “advantage” they had over Christians, as they alone could read the Bible in the original text. As Leonard Rutgers puts it, “Justinian realized full well that their access to Hebrew gave the Jews power.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-29" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a> By forbidding them the study of the Mishnah, moreover, he was going even further in seeking to strip them of their own interpretation of scripture. In a sense, he thus sought to leave them no alternative to eventually accepting the Christian interpretation of scripture. As mentioned in <a href="part0010_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2" class="calibre3">Chapter 1</a>, it is no mere chance that the redaction of the Mishnah, in the last decades of the second century, strictly parallels the first mentions (by Irenaeus) of the corpus which we call the New Testament. Throughout the second century, both Jews and Christians, in a series of battles over self-definition, had confronted the pagans, their own different interpretations, which would soon become “heresies,” and one another. In a sense, one can speak of a race between the two communities, throughout the century, to find the correct hermeneutical key for the correct understanding of scripture. Both the New Testament and the Mishnah gradually became the proposed keys: either the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible were announcing the coming of the Messiah, or they were to <span id="page_185"></span>be understood as the Law of Israel, to be interpreted through the rabbinic authorities. By forbidding Jews to study the Mishnah, Justinian was stripping them of their own religious autonomy and transforming them, as it were, into a heterodox or heretical Christian community. He thus clearly stated the hope that reading the prophetic texts that announced the coming of Christ might eventually lead Jews to convert. All the same, if the Jews were becoming Christian heretics of sorts, they remained privileged heretics, since they still had the right to an existence, albeit constrained by various impositions, and sometimes by persecution. I should like to add that by defining a tolerated, though inferior status for the Jews, Justinian laid the foundation for the Islamic attitude to non-Muslim monotheists—“peoples of the Book” (sing. <i class="calibre1">ahl al-kitāb</i>), as the Qu’ran calls them, a term that would soon include Zoroastrians alongside Jews and Christians—as legitimate but subordinate minorities, or <i class="calibre1">dhimmis</i>, under Muslim sovereignty. As we saw in <a href="part0017_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7" class="calibre3">Chapter 6</a>, the Islamic concept of the <i class="calibre1">dhimmi</i> can be found <i class="calibre1">in nuce</i> in Justinian’s attitude to the Jews. The Muslim conquerors of the Near Eastern Byzantine provinces would only need to broaden its use to Christians as well.</p>
<p class="para">The Byzantine transformation of Judaism into a kind of Christian heresy, which strikes us as paradoxical, made sense internally. For early Christian thinkers, the history of Christianity (and of heresy) started with humanity, rather than with the Incarnation. <i class="calibre1">Anima naturaliter christiana</i>, “The soul is by nature Christian,” wrote Tertullian even before the end of the second century. Indeed, from the very beginnings of humanity, Christianity had represented the only authentic and legitimate religious position.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-30" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a> This idea, launched by Paul (Rom. 1: 18–23), had been echoed by Eusebius in the fourth century. Christian thinkers remained unable to conceive of a monotheism shared by a number of different, legitimate religions. Since Christianity was <i class="calibre1">verus Israel, vetus Israel</i> represented a perversion of Christian truth and was, in a way, a heresy.</p>
