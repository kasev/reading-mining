<p class="parafl">Fourth-century Judaism and Christianity were religions that had undergone some deep transformations. They were in their essence sacrificial religions, but of a special kind, since no sacrifice actually took place. Structurally, these religions were, of course, vastly different, because of the absence of priests and monks among the Jews. As a consequence of this state of affairs, the synagogue, or <i class="calibre1">beit ha-midrash</i> (literally, “house of hermeneutics”), became a polyvalent centre of cultic and cultural activity unequalled in Christianity, where cult and culture usually remained clearly distinguished—the first in church, the second in the monastery.</p>
<p class="para">Both Judaism and Christianity were originally eschatological religions, but in both, as we saw in <a href="part0015_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6" class="calibre3">Chapter 5</a>, the eschatological drive had been more or less neutralized, and was now limited to episodes of flaring messianism or to marginalized groups. Both were establishing themselves as “religions of the book,” in a cultural environment that remained largely based upon orality. Among the Jews, in particular, as among other cultures of the Near East, such as the Iranians, the idea of the book itself remained to a great extent oral. Among the rabbis, books were certainly redacted, but not committed to writing.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-18" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a> Last but not least, both Judaism and Christianity had succeeded, in the preceding centuries, in establishing orthodoxies. In various ways, <span id="page_111"></span>dissenting tendencies had been declared heretical and marginalized. Among the Christians, these groups were now in the process of simply being outlawed, like pagans. That left the Jews as the only officially authorized dissenting religious group in the Christian empire. From one strong perspective, Christianity could be seen as a Jewish heresy—but it had now turned the tables on <i class="calibre1">vetus Israel</i>, and had transformed Judaism, as it were, into a Christian heresy.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-27"></span>
