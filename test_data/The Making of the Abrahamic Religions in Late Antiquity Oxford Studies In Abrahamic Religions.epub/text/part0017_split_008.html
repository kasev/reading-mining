<p class="parafl">In any case, both genres show the extent to which Jews and Christians, in Byzantine Palestine, shared a very similar hermeneutical tradition of the same texts, even though they were reading them and commenting upon them in different languages. Indeed, the idea of a common life, or <i class="calibre1">koinos bios</i>, should refer not only to the material aspects of life, but also to intellectual and spiritual life, to patterns of mind and of religious life. The case for such an intellectual and spiritual <i class="calibre1">koinos bios</i> might be made, of course, for all the various groups living in Byzantine Palestine, including Samaritans and polytheists, both Hellenized and Bedouins. But it is all the more true about Jews and Christians.</p>
<p class="para">The comparative study of synagogal and Byzantine liturgical poetry (respectively <i class="calibre1">piyyut</i> and <i class="calibre1">kontakia</i>), which has barely begun, might also shed light on the dynamics between minority and majority culture in Byzantine Palestine. We have here, in both cases, a highly sophisticated literary genre whose origins remain unclear. The audience of the <i class="calibre1">piyyut</i> (from Greek <i class="calibre1">poiēsis</i>) must have been educated Jews, who would have memorized the Bible. Note that the word itself testifies to the acculturation process in which the phenomenon belongs. The <i class="calibre1">piyyut</i> offers unambiguous evidence for the rabbinization of liturgical practice in sixth-century Palestine, as Seth <span id="page_115"></span>Schwartz reminds us (he also points out that we do not know how widespread the practice was).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-23" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Following Pirkoi ben Baboi (ninth-tenth century Babylonia), Steven Bowman has speculated that <i class="calibre1">piyyutim</i> offered a legitimate way (since it was done within the legally permitted synagogal cult) to study the law through a poetic summary. This argument takes into account Justinian’s Novella 146, promulgated in 553, forbidding the study of the <i class="calibre1">deuterōsis</i> (a term that does not refer exclusively to the Mishna but is a generic term referring to commentaries).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-24" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> This law also interfered with Jewish cult (something unheard of until then) by demanding the use of specific biblical translations and threatening those who denied resurrection, the last judgment, and the angels. Justinian also enforced baptism upon the Jews. The Novella may have been meant as the Emperor’s retaliation for the Jews’ support of the Donatists and the Arian Visigoths. Procopius tells us that it was then that the treasures of the Temple were brought from Rome to Constantinople.</p>
<p class="para">One should also analyze the <i class="calibre1">piyyut</i> together with other kinds of Christian poetry, such as Ephrem’s hymns. We know from Chrysostom, after all, that at least in late fourth-century Antioch, Christians could participate in synagogal services more than was acceptable to the clergy. Similar attitudes may have appeared in Byzantine Palestine or elsewhere. In 407, Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius issued a law against “the new crime of superstition” of “the unheard name of heaven worshippers (<i class="calibre1">caelicolae</i>).” The name of this group active in the early fifth century might point to their identity as later followers of the Judaizers of old, the <i class="calibre1">theosebeis</i>, or God fearers, <i class="calibre1">yir’ei shamaim</i> (<i class="calibre1">phoboumenoi, metuentes</i>).</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-31"></span>
