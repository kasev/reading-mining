<p class="parafl">As is well known, the concept of <i class="calibre1">theokratia</i> (a very rare term in Greek) first appears in Josephus’s polemical work <i class="calibre1">Against Apion</i> (II. 155–73 and 184–5). Josephus, who seems to have invented the term, uses it to describe the unique pattern of political organization of the ancient Hebrews.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-4" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> According to Josephus, Moses, the legislator (<i class="calibre1">nomothetēs</i>) of the Hebrews, who had God as his guide and counselor, rejected all known political systems, such as monarchy or democracy, and decided to place all sovereignty and authority in the hands of God. Josephus adds that the Greek philosophers, such as Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Plato, and the Stoics, were all students of Moses in that matter. In radical distinction from the Hebrew model, however, the Greek philosophers retained an esoteric character to their political conceptions, only revealing their true views to their advanced students and hiding them from the public at large. Josephus adds that one of the characteristics of the Law of Moses was the fact that for him religion was not, as elsewhere, “a department of virtue,” but, on the contrary, religion was for the Hebrews all-encompassing and ethics had become part of religion (<i class="calibre1">eusebeia</i>). This is, of course, a point of vital importance, entailing a major transformation of the status of religion in society. For Philo, in contradistinction to Josephus, Moses was not only a legislator, but also a prophet. Although Philo does not speak of <i class="calibre1">theokratia</i>, he describes the <span id="page_125"></span>Hebrew polity established by Moses as being under the direct leadership of God. Although it cannot be argued with certainty, there is, therefore, a real possibility that Josephus was influenced by Philo’s discussion in his own work.</p>
<p class="para">At the time of Josephus’s writing, in the 90s of the first century <span class="sc">ce</span> in Rome, Jewish theocracy belonged to the past. The destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 <span class="sc">ce</span> and the military defeat of the Jews in their war against the Romans had crushed any serious aspiration to renewed political independence of the Jewish nation. This military catastrophe would soon be followed, in the 30s of the second century, by another defeat in the second revolt against Rome, which obliterated the dream for a Jewish national renewal in Palestine. From then on, and until the birth of the modern Jewish national movement in the late nineteenth century, Jews would more or less give up on the political expression of Jewish identity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-5" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> Even the theoretical discussion of political regimes and legitimacy remains embryonic in late antique and medieval Jewish literature. In late antique rabbinic literature (both from Babylonia and from Palestine), the figure of the sage had replaced both that of the priest and that of the prophet. Discussion of the Temple law and of sacrificial practices has an eerie character about it, at best referring to an uncertain reconstruction of the Temple in the eschatological future. The rabbis expressed very little interest in political reflection, while Jewish medieval philosophers and theologians, such as Maimonides, when they dealt with the political dimension of the Israelite commonwealth, referred to their highly speculative reconstruction of the biblical world. For all practical purposes, the rabbis had put aside political ambitions, focusing rather on the development of personal piety, family religion, and, at most, the judicial autonomy of Jewish communities. In Weberian terms, one could speak of the radical “depoliticization,” or <i class="calibre1">Entpolitisierung</i> of Judaism, and hence of the disappearance of the state.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-6" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> Under such conditions, it is obvious that theocracy is not a real option, and that the term has no concrete relevance.</p>
<p class="para">For the Jews, then, after the destruction of the Temple, the idea of theocracy primarily belonged to the past. The past is also projected in the eschatological future, the messianic times. Then, the former glorious state of affairs will be reinstated and the Temple rebuilt. The Messiah himself is certainly a “theocratic” figure, as he will establish the kingdom of God upon the earth.</p>
