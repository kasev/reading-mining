<p class="parafl">In our period, significant Jewish communities existed throughout the Christian Roman Empire, whether in the East or West. Christian attitudes toward Jews, both public and private, apparently varied in different areas. If there was cultural exclusivity in Byzantium, for instance, the fact that there were fewer Jews in the West does not seem to have promoted more lenient attitudes towards them. On the contrary, anti-Jewish legislation evidently was harsher in the West. But the most important Jewish communities of later antiquity were located outside the Roman Empire. We find significant Jewish communities in Arabia, for instance, where the Jewish king Dhu Nuwwas (517–25) persecuted the Negus Christians in Najran. Jews also lived elsewhere in the Near East, particularly in the Sasanian Empire.</p>
<p class="para">Palestine represents a special case, as both the historical country of the Jews, who call it “the land of Israel,” and that of the Christians who would learn to name it “the holy land” (a term which appears for the first time in sixth-century hagiographical literature from Palestine). We know little of Jewish communities in Alexandria—and in the rest of Egypt—after the mid-second century. In North Africa, where the existence of notable communities is attested from the times of Tertullian to those of Augustine, we remain in the dark as to their size and their activities, including their cultural life—though there is nothing to suggest much consequence to either. Some similarities between Tertullian’s patterns of thought and Jewish law are not enough to permit extrapolations. Jews who thought they had been wronged in a real-estate deal could ask for justice and protection from Bishop Augustine, but he does not seem to know very much about (or to retain an interest in) Jewish practices.</p>
<p class="para">There were Jewish communities in Visigothic Spain, but here too, the scant evidence is enough to suggest that they were dwindling at the time of the Islamic invasion. Isidore of Seville, in the seventh century, does not seem to have met Jews. Everywhere in the Roman Empire, Jews formed minority communities, while Christians asserted themselves as belonging to the majority. This imbalance was shattered only in the Sasanian Empire, where both Jews and Christians represented minorities, rather similar in various ways. This important situation is interesting in the relations between Christians and Jews in the Euphrates valley during late antiquity.</p>
<p class="para">After the fourth century, the evidence about Jews in general, and about Jewish–Christian relationships in particular, is twofold: archaeological and literary. The former can sometimes be used to sharpen the insights provided by the latter.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-12" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> While the archaeological data from Byzantine Palestine is <span id="page_108"></span>remarkable, the remains of Jewish synagogues or funerary monuments in the Diaspora are meager. As for Jewish documents, we have nothing except the literature produced in both Palestine and Mesopotamia, to which should be added the various magical inscriptions on bowls or papyri. On the other hand, the evidence provided by Christian texts is mainly of a theological nature and includes biblical exegesis, spiritual exhortation, homiletics, and polemical, as well as theological, tractates. To these sources should be added imperial legislation, in particular as it appears in the codices of Theodosius and of Justinian, which tells us a lot about daily practices and conceptions.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-25"></span>
