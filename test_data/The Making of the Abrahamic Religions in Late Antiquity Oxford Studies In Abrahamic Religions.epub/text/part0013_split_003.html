<p class="parafl">As is well known, the idea of prophecy is absolutely essential to Ebionite theology, in particular as it appears in the Pseudo-Clementine <i class="calibre1">Homilies</i>. For the Ebionites, the identity of Jesus is defined by his prophecy. Jesus is for them the last incarnation of the “true prophet,” who, since Adam, from generation to generation, presents the divine message to mankind. In each generation, however, the true prophet is preceded by a false prophet, an impostor sent by Satan who masquerades as the true prophet. Truth and falsehood are thus for ever coupled, throughout the ages, in “syzygies” of opposites. The false prophets are “the prophets of this world,” who remain forever ignorant of eternal truths.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-35" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-35" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">35</sup></a> Thus Cain precedes Abel, Ishmael precedes Isaac, Esau precedes Jacob, Aharon <span id="page_67"></span>precedes Moses, and Paul precedes Peter. False prophets are feminine, and are born from women. Just as true prophecy stems from Adam, false prophecy stems from Eve. False prophets are impostors, who bring a false doctrine. Hence, a false gospel precedes the revelation of the true gospel.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-36" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-36" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">36</sup></a> Although this doctrine of the syzygies is well known, it has been granted too little attention in the context of polemics against false prophets in ancient Christian literature. If the many false prophets are so dangerous for mankind, it is because they mislead men, as they succeed in presenting error as truth, in order to ensure the acceptance of their doctrines (cf. Matt. 7: 15). Truth and error thus appear as mixed and a test is necessary in order to distinguish true prophets from impostors.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-37" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-37" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">37</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The Elchasaites were a group of Jewish-Christians from Syria.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-38" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-38" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">38</sup></a> We know that they prayed toward Jerusalem (in contradistinction to “mainstream” Christian communities), and that they were practicing constant baptisms in order to remain pure. The lost <i class="calibre1">Book of Elchasai</i>, finally, which dates from the early second century, and which it was claimed had been written by the mythical founder of the sect, also mentions the insidious presence of false prophets “among us.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-39" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-39" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">39</sup></a> The central importance of Elchasaite traditions stems from the fact that thanks to the discovery and publication of the Cologne Mani-Codex, we now know that Mani grew up among Elchasaites, that is, a Jewish-Christian, baptist community, and that he revolted in his youth against its system of practices.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-40" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-40" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">40</sup></a> Mani, indeed, conceived of his religious message as a return to the true belief distorted by the Jewish-Christian baptists of his youth. For the Christian heresiographers, from Epiphanius and the anonymous <i class="calibre1">Acta Archelai</i> to Augustine, who tell us much of what we know about him and his thought, Mani was a false prophet, a magician (<i class="calibre1">goēs</i>), and an impostor, who had learned his craft from his master Scythianus, trying in vain to accomplish true miracles. For the church fathers, his very name reveals his folly, his <i class="calibre1">mania.</i>
<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-41" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-41" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">41</sup></a> What is of direct interest to us here is that <span id="page_68"></span>Mani’s theology retains the conception of a succession of prophets from Adam to Mani—a conception which he manifestly got from the Elchasaites. The Manichaean conception, however, is more complex than the Ebionite one, as it involves not a single, but a <i class="calibre1">double</i> chain of prophecy. The concept of a “seal of prophecy” appears in some Manichaean texts, where the expression does not seem to refer to the fact that Mani is the last prophet sent to humankind, but refers, rather, to Mani’s disciples, who are the “seal” of his prophecy, that is, they are the testimony and the proof of its authentic character.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-42" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-42" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">42</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">A double list of prophets, sent throughout history and to the different regions of the world, is typical of the Manichaean structure of prophecy. On the one hand, there is a diachronic list of prophets, from Adam to Christ to Mani, which includes prophets of the antediluvian times such as Enoch—but not the biblical prophets properly so called. The synchronic list, on the other hand, mentions Buddha in the East, Zarathustra in the central lands, and Jesus in the West, all preceding Mani. Each was sent only to one area of the world, while Mani, the only prophet to offer a total revelation, valid for all peoples in the entire <i class="calibre1">oikoumenē</i>, seals prophecy.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-43" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-43" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">43</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">As far as my knowledge goes, the Manichaean double chain of prophecy, both through the ages and through the universe, has always been considered by scholars to be an original theme, devised by Mani himself, the first thinker <span id="page_69"></span>to have established a consciously universal religion. If my analysis above is correct, this <i class="calibre1">communis opinio</i> should be qualified. The Manichaean double chain of prophecy is strikingly reminiscent of Tatian’s and Clement’s conception of two chains of <i class="calibre1">barbaros philosophia</i>, that of the Hebrews and those of the Eastern barbarian peoples. The similarities between these two mythological frames seem too close to be the fruit of chance. It stands to reason, therefore, that the basic structure of Manichaean revelation throughout the generations and among the different cultures was not a total novelty. Rather, it appears to be a new development, stemming from an already existing Christian scheme. This scheme was accepted, in particular, by those Christian thinkers who kept a particular interest in traditions of the East.</p>
