<p class="parafl">The whole field of popular piety, magic, and holy men must be considered. The evidence for relationships between the two groups is here much less ambiguous than in theological or mystical thought, although the lack of sources here remains even more dire than elsewhere. Jewish holy men played in their community, <i class="calibre1">mutatis mutandis</i>, a role similar to that played by Christian holy men in their community. Popular religion is in many ways a problematic concept, postulating a dubious two-tiered hierarchy. But, there is certainly a middle ground, a “religious <i class="calibre1">koinē</i>,” where Jews and Christians (and not only they) meet, both in an urban context and in the villages. <span id="page_121"></span>The clearest example of such a religious “commonwealth” is probably the role of magical beliefs and practices. The magical papyri from Egypt, both in Greek and in Coptic, show a considerable amount of religious syncretism and interest in showing off Jewish (or “Hebrew-sounding”) theophoric words and names. New discoveries of Aramaic magic bowls from late ancient Mesopotamia highlight such common practices of Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and others, such as Mandaeans or Manichaeans.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-33" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-33" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">33</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">As noted, the real common ground of Christians and Jews in late antiquity was not so much the Old Testament, which offered the major cause for the permanent clashes between them. It was, rather, the ground they shared with the other communities throughout the Mediterranean and the Near East, a <i class="calibre1">tertium quid</i> that did not reflect any specific religious identity. The innumerable and invisible demons which magic practices were meant to tame did not really belong to either the realm of God or that of Satan. They were, simply, part of the structure of the universe, as objective as sun and moon, rain and drought.</p>
<p class="para">Underlying the conflicting theological and ethnic identities, there existed in the late ancient Mediterranean and Near East what I have called a “religious <i class="calibre1">koinē</i>” of shared implicit assumptions. This “religious commonwealth” was primarily magical beliefs and practices. It is almost impossible to disentangle religion from magic, at least in the ancient world; yet too often scholars have assumed magic to belong to the sphere of “popular religion,” leaving the higher spheres of theology “intact.” The role of the <i class="calibre1">Chaldean Oracles</i> and the place of theurgy in later Neoplatonism would be sufficient to cast serious doubts on such a view. In late antiquity, magic apparently moved up and became more readily acceptable to the higher classes, including the intellectuals. Certainly both the church fathers and the rabbis strongly condemn magic, which they usually consider as the alien, doubtful, and dangerous religiosity of the other. But, a closer investigation shows that their own attitudes also accept the principles of magical thought and practice. Recent scholarship has shown a broad diffusion of magic among both Palestinian and Babylonian Jews, and among the rabbis. Magical power is part of the holy man’s charisma, also among the desert monks. From Egypt through Palestine to Babylonia, spells, formulae, bowls, and papyri provide a glimpse of a wide spectrum of magic themes and practices. In this respect, there are some obvious links between magic and mysticism, reflected both in Jewish and in Christian texts.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-36"></span><span id="page_122"></span>
