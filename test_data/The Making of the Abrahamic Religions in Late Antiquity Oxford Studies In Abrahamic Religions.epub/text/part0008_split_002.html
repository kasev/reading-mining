The word “monotheism” itself, however, is relatively new, and appeared for the first time in English in 1660, in the Cambridge Platonist Henry More’s <i class="calibre1">Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness</i>. It gained currency in English only around 1750, later still entering German, French, and Italian.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-24" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> It may be worth noticing the dramatic peak in the frequency of its use, in English at least, in the last decade of the nineteenth century.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-25" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a> This was in the heyday of the British Empire, when <span id="page_10"></span>Victorian writers were puzzled by the flamboyance of Indian polytheistic traditions.</p>
<p class="para">The question of monotheism can be asked from upstream (why one god rather than many?) or from downstream (why one god rather than none?). We usually seem to accept, at least implicitly, as a working hypothesis, that the number of gods declines steadily in human history, in a constant process of simplification. If so, then one god gets very close to no god at all. Were not the Jews called godless, <i class="calibre1">atheoi</i>, by Apollonius of Molon, in the first century <span class="sc">bce</span>, as Josephus testifies?<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-26" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a> This historical process of simplification can also be regarded as one of rationalization, and in a sense, this is what Max Weber referred to when speaking about the “disenchantment of the world” (<i class="calibre1">Entzauberung der Welt</i>). Rationalization means the constant simplification of the system of the universe, and hence the shrinking number, with time, of the divine powers in charge of it. In this paradigm, religious evolution usually takes place through revolution. In the ancient world Akhenaten, Zarathustra, and Nabonidus had tried, each in his own way, to insist on a dramatic simplification of the heavenly world: only one god was the true one, or the only one worthy of worship. Akhenaten’s “monotheism,” however, has also been described as a “cosmotheism,” while Nabonidus’s devotion to Sin, the moon god, may be more adequately described as henotheism.</p>
<p class="para">The late nineteenth century saw the development of the historical and comparative study of religion as a new discipline, at the crossroads of theology and the humanities. Since then, various theories regarding the origin of monotheism have been propounded. For the Scottish polymath Andrew Lang, even some of the most “primitive” tribes believed in a high god, the “All Father.” In the first half of the twentieth century, Lang’s theory, which was never widely accepted, was defended and developed by the Austrian anthropologist and Catholic priest Wilhelm Schmidt, who spoke of <i class="calibre1">Urmonotheismus</i>, in his massive <i class="calibre1">Der Ursprung der Gottesidee</i>, and by the Italian historian of religion Raffaele Pettazzoni.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-27" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-27" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">27</sup></a> In a sense, this approach, which rejected the above-mentioned paradigm of an evolution of religious ideas towards monotheism, represented a return to Paul’s views. For Paul, and not only for him, knowledge of the one God was present in the earliest stages of humankind, but became eventually blurred. Polytheism, in this view, represents a degeneration of monotheism: “and they <span id="page_11"></span>exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling a mortal being or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles” (Rom 1: 23).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-28" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">According to the more commonly accepted scholarly trajectory, ancient Israel moved from polytheism to monotheism through henotheism. The traces of this trajectory, from the earliest biblical texts to the Second Isaiah, show a combination of evolution and revolution.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-29" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a> Scholarship has usually focused on the formation of the Hebrew Bible and the religious history of ancient Israel, on the early development of Christianity in the Roman Empire,<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-30" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a> and on the emergence of Islam at the very end of late antiquity. For the French Semitist Ernest Renan, around the mid-nineteenth century, monotheism was the single significant contribution of the Semites to humankind. In his view, from India to Europe, the Aryan peoples lived in countries where the lushness of nature (mountains, rivers, forests) fed creative imagination in all fields, from literature, arts, and sciences to politics. The minds and sensitivities of the Semites, on the other hand, suffered from the poverty and emptiness of their natural habitat. Only one idea could be born in the desert, that of the one, solitary God.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-31" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-31" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">31</sup></a> “Le désert est monothéiste,” would claim Renan. The great inventors of monotheism were the Israelite prophets. They were also the predecessors of Jesus, whom Renan calls “a man so great that one might even call him God” (a sentence which cost him the chair at the Collège de France to which he had just been elected). Islam, for Renan the last great religious invention of humankind, was for him also the weakest, as it represented the least attractive kind of monotheistic religion imaginable.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-32" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-32" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">32</sup></a> The spiritual poverty of Islam explained for Renan the fundamental failure of Islamic societies to modernize and to accept the challenges of modern science.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-33" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-33" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">33</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Renan’s bleak vision of Islamic monotheism reflects a deeply ingrained ambivalence on the part of many scholars stemming from a Christian background: in their view there had been a steady progression in the refinement of religious ideas from ancient Israel to Christ. From Jesus to Muhammad, however, there could only be regression. For them, the fact that Islamic <span id="page_12"></span>monotheism seemed so pure actually reflected its inherent poverty and a lack of sophistication.</p>
<p class="para">The long late antiquity, between, more or less, the birth of Christianity and that of Islam, represents a crucial period in the history of religion. During this period, monotheism eventually became “the politically correct religious idiom.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-34" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-34" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">34</sup></a> In the last two decades, there has been mounting recognition of the importance of monotheistic trends among Hellenic thinkers under the Roman Empire.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-35" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-35" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">35</sup></a> For Platonic philosophers, in particular, the pyramid of beings culminated in the One, the supreme god. Whether references to <i class="calibre1">Hypsistos Theos</i> (the Highest God), or exclamatory lapidary inscriptions like <i class="calibre1">Heis Theos!</i> (One God!) stem from Jewish, Christian, or pagan milieus is still being discussed.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-36" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-36" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">36</sup></a> In the present context, however, we need to point out the obvious, that is, that this pagan monotheism is a far cry from Abrahamic monotheism, either of the Jewish or of the Christian persuasion. Whether the Roman world was moving towards monotheism (or at least towards henotheism), and whether this reflected Jewish or Christian prodding, as it were, we cannot know for sure. What is certain is the conflation of Greek and Israelite forms of monotheism in the Roman Empire. Late antique religion can be described as an intercultural system in which a dynamic process permitted the transformation of religious conceptualization and practice.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-37" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-37" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">37</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Scholarly tradition follows cultural habits, inherited from Christianity, in considering monotheism as the motor of religious change in late antiquity: it is perceived as being at the very core of the great clash between pagans and <span id="page_13"></span>Christians. Scholarly tradition, however, focuses on discourse rather than on practice, and may not take ancient perceptions sufficiently into account. For Augustine, for instance, it is forms of worship, rather than theological conceptions, that are the main criterion of religious identity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-38" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-38" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">38</sup></a> Similarly, Emperor Julian writes: “…I wish to show that the Jews agree with the Gentiles (<i class="calibre1">tois ethnesin</i>), except that they believe in only one God. That is indeed peculiar to them and strange to us, since all the rest we have in a manner in common with them – temples, sanctuaries, altars, purifications, and certain precepts. For as to these we differ from one another either not at all or in trivial matters.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-39" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-39" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">39</sup></a> Julian rejected the Christian God of his youth, and sought to return to Hellenic tradition. He never quite succeeded, however, in becoming a real polytheist, and his arguments against the “Galileans” reveal him to have remained, at heart, a monotheist. What he reproaches the God of Moses for is not so much his uniqueness as his character: he is jealous (<i class="calibre1">baskanos</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-40" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-40" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">40</sup></a> He is, moreover, “a particular (<i class="calibre1">merikon</i>) god,” while the Hellenes know to “recognize the God of the All” (<i class="calibre1">ton tōn holōn theon</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-41" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-41" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">41</sup></a> God does not need Revelation in order for humans to recognize him, since “the human race possesses its knowledge of God by nature and not from teaching,” a fact proved “by the universal yearning for the divine that is in all men.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-42" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-42" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">42</sup></a> Even for as loud an advocate of polytheism as the Platonist philosopher Proclus, a century later, “all forms of religions and sects accept the existence of the very first cause, and all men call it a helping god,” while not all recognize the existence of lower gods, as “The One shows itself with more evidence than plurality.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-43" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-43" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">43</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">While pagans were sometimes not real polytheists, Christians often seemed to believe in more than one god—an accusation common in Jewish and Muslim anti-Christian polemics through the ages. I refer here not so much to the Trinity, a belief that was not universal among Christians before the fourth century, but to the hierarchy of two divine beings, God the Father and Jesus Christ. Let me quote here at some length a striking passage from Origen’s <i class="calibre1">Dialogue with Heraclides</i>, a work written in the 240s, relating a theological discussion between bishops:</p>

<p class="parafl">This striking dialog, which Islamicists may find quaintly reminiscent of a Kalam argument, may well be the best proof text in all of Patristic literature showing that the doctrine of the Trinity is inescapably polytheistic.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-45" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-45" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">45</sup></a> It clearly reflects the complicated way in which third-century Christian intellectuals grappled with their theology, a way whose definition as strict monotheism may seem questionable to the outsider. The hierarchical or “vertical” dualism, integrating two divine persons in the Godhead, was not really a Christian invention. Since Hellenistic times, a number of Jewish, usually apocryphal texts had referred to a second divine figure, next to God and beneath Him, Enoch being probably the most common such figure. The same dualistic structure of the Divinity was retained in a number of traditions from the rabbinic period, usually centered on the figure of Metatron (“he who sits near the Divine throne”?) or of another archangel. Various rabbinic sources mention that there are “two Powers in heaven” (<i class="calibre1">shtei rashuyot ba-shammayim</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-46" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-46" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">46</sup></a> Such traditions, complex as they are, have of course been studied, but it may <span id="page_15"></span>be fair to say that the significant split in the Divinity that they reflect has not always been appreciated enough. Not unsurprisingly, scholars have often been loath to recognize dualistic trends within “orthodox” Judaism, which claimed to retain the purity of monotheism while confronting Christian “bitheism,” or at least “binarian” monotheism. One may postulate that the existence of Christianity is what restrained the development of such hierarchies within the divine world in late antique rabbinic literature.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-47" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-47" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">47</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">It is probably the presence of all the different kinds of dualist heresies, which we usually refer to, globally, as Gnosticism, that has prevented a more precise scholarly diagnostic about the existence of a dualism within biblical monotheism in general, and Christian theology in particular. Like the rabbis, the church fathers insisted upon the dualist nature of many of the heresies they were fighting, whitewashing the dualist proclivities inherent to their own belief system. On the other hand, Christian apologists wished to give the impression that they had a monopoly on monotheism. To a great extent, modern scholarship has accepted this emic perception of things.</p>
<p class="para">I cannot offer here even a schematic taxonomy of Gnostic dualism. Suffice it to note that the sources offer a number of different conceptions of dualism. In his <i class="calibre1">Epistle to Flora</i>, Ptolemy, a second-century disciple of Valentinus, offers an introduction of sorts to Gnostic doctrine, in which the material world was created by the demiurge, a god lower than the perfect and highest God, who is the Father of Jesus Christ. While the Father is good (or merciful), the demiurge is only just (or strict)—but he is not evil by nature. Similarly, the arch-heretic Marcion, in the mid-second century, claims the God of the Old Testament, the demiurge, is lower than the Good God, but he does not quite demonize him. The only strict and radical dualism emerging from the biblical tradition would be that of Manichaeism, starting in the mid-third century. For Mani, who had grown up among the Elchasaites, a sect of Jewish-Christian Baptists, hierarchical dualism became a dualism of strict opposition. The Good and spiritual God confronted the Evil and material Devil, each with his own kingdom, and with his own troops, the sons of light fighting the sons of darkness. Such a radical dualism recalls the strong dualistic structure of some of the Dead Sea Scrolls (reflected for instance in the war between the sons of light and the sons of darkness). It stands to reason that in both cases this “horizontal” dualism originated in Iran. But even in Manichaeism, the balance is tipped, and the final result of the grand battle between the King of Light and the Prince of Darkness is known in advance: the forces of good will win, those of evil will be defeated forever.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-48" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-48" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">48</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_16"></span>The ubiquity of dualist proclivities in various forms of late antique monotheism calls for an explanation. If it seems that a dualist tension is inherent to biblical monotheism, it is because this monotheism (in contradistinction to pagan monotheism) insists on the ethical aspect of God, and seeks to offer a theodicy: <i class="calibre1">Unde malum?</i> (Whence Evil?) is a major question that cannot be avoided. I propose to see in the centrality of the ethical dimension a core component of the Abrahamic religions, perhaps even more significant than the simple idea of God’s unity. The Islamicist Henry Corbin has called the necessity for the One to become multiple in order to be worshipped “the paradox of monotheism.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-49" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-49" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">49</sup></a> There is indeed a paradox inherent to monotheism, different from the so-called “omnipotence paradox” addressed by Averroes. Monotheism entails the propensity of a split in the divine, transcendent unity. This split can take one of the many forms of dualism and trinitarianism. Angelology, other divine hierarchies, and anthropomorphism should also be perceived as related to this paradox.</p>
<p class="para">As we have seen, then, late antique Jewish, Christian, Gnostic, and pagan forms of monotheism were never simply “pure.” Similarly, in both Manichaeism and Sasanian Zoroastrianism, dualism was never total. Within the latter, moreover, the Zurvanian heresy represents a clear attempt to move from a dualist to a monist worldview.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-50" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-50" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">50</sup></a> When pagans converted to Christianity, it is probably not the desire to confess God’s unity that mainly moved them. If pagan monotheism failed, writes Gillian Clark, it is because it was at once too exclusive (its teachings were accessible to few) and too inclusive (it did not prohibit the cult of the gods).</p>
<p class="para">Indeed, pagan monotheism eventually failed, but it would be a mistake to think that there was only one possible trajectory in late antiquity. Marinus of Neapolis (the ancient Shechem and the modern Nablus, in Samaria) was the successor of Proclus as the head of the Athenian Academy. His disciple Damascius reports that “born a Samaritan, Marinus renounced their creed [<i class="calibre1">doxan</i>] (which is anyway a deviation [<i class="calibre1">kainotomian</i>] from Abraham’s religion [<i class="calibre1">thrēskeias</i>]) and embraced Hellenism.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-51" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-51" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">51</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Such a text highlights the fact that Abraham was perceived as a culture hero of sorts much beyond Jewish and Christian communities. As students of Islamic origins have long known, some sources—few, but significant—tell us <span id="page_17"></span>about “Abrahamic” traditions, and festivals, crossing the boundaries of traditional religious communities. In late antiquity, both Jews and Christians claimed, of course, to be the only true followers of Abraham’s true religion. The Qur’an’s claims about Jews and Christians having departed, in different ways, from Abraham’s pure inheritance, seem to apply to Christians the same accusation that early Christians had hurled at Jews, namely that they had perverted Abraham’s true religion.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-52" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-52" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">52</sup></a> Abraham’s religion, indeed, was in late antiquity broadly perceived as true monotheism—almost as natural religion.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-53" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-53" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">53</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Recent research has detected, since at least the late fourth century, a significant monotheist presence in the Western Arabian peninsula, from the Hejaz to the Yemen, beyond the Jewish and Christian communities. Although we do not know the precise nature of this monotheism, it appears to have had what one could call a Jewish “flavor.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-54" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-54" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">54</sup></a> Hence, when we speak, as is becoming increasingly fashionable, of the Qur’an as a “late antique text,” we ought to remember that it is a very specific kind of late antiquity that is referred to here: that of Abrahamic religions, not that of Hellenic <i class="calibre1">paideia</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-55" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-55" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">55</sup></a> Both Gerald Hawting and Patricia Crone have argued that the <i class="calibre1">mushrikūn</i> of the Qur’an (literally “those who associate” [another divine figure with the One God]), were monotheists rather than polytheists, as was traditionally argued.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-56" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-56" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">56</sup></a> The gist of my brief presentation would seem to corroborate, to some extent, their argument: <i class="calibre1">Shirk</i> seems to lie at the very heart of monotheism.</p>
<p class="para">Monotheism comes in different shapes and colors, and it almost never comes pure. Like all religious systems, it remains essentially unstable; it is given to permanent evolution and sometimes to radical transformation. Late antique Abrahamic monotheism was either universalist—Christianity and Islam, or particularist—Judaism. For Christians as well as for Muslims, the same religious truth is to be shared by all humanity—all individuals and all peoples. Jews, on the other hand, thrived through the ages on the paradox of a universal God and a chosen people. Early on, the God of Israel had entered into a contractual relationship with his people, Abraham’s true offspring, transformed by the covenant into a priestly nation and a saintly people. <span id="page_18"></span>While their national God soon became universal, the Jews insisted in retaining, through the ages, their national identity.</p>
<p class="para">Abrahamic monotheism has some far-reaching implications, also on the political level. The German Catholic theologian Erik Peterson had argued as much in <i class="calibre1">Monotheismus als politisches Problem</i>, a seminal book published in 1935, written with the intention of fighting the perverse uses of Christianity in Nazi Germany. Another German scholar, the Egyptologist and historian of religion Jan Assmann, has recently caused stormy polemical waves with what he calls “the Mosaic distinction,” a concept he first developed in <i class="calibre1">Moses the Egyptian</i> (1998).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-57" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-57" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">57</sup></a> According to Assmann, the Hebrew Bible proposed a new conception of religion, unknown to the archaic world, according to which religion is essentially a matter of truth, rather than of tradition. For Assmann, it is the traditions embedded in the Hebrew Bible that lie at the roots of religious intolerance and violence in the Western world. Assmann’s views have brought him some virulent criticism, as well as misplaced accusations of anti-Semitism. In an article published recently in the <i class="calibre1">Revue de l’Histoire des Religions</i>, Assmann has responded to this criticism, noting that in contradistinction to Christianity and Islam, rabbinic Judaism is not guilty of religious intolerance.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-58" href="part0008_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-1-note-58" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">58</sup></a> For the rabbis, the seven Noachide commandments imposed by God upon all humankind except the Israelites permitted all men (and women) to lead a saintly life without converting to Judaism. If the particularist form of monotheism professed by the rabbis does not fit the intolerant character of other monotheisms, I should like to suggest that it may well be because this intolerant character does not belong to monotheism per se, but only to <i class="calibre1">universalist</i> forms of monotheism.</p>
<p class="para">For Renan, as we saw, Islam was the latest, and the least, of the Abrahamic religions. The Hungarian Jewish scholar Ignaz Goldziher, who was probably the most impressive modern student of Islam, strongly objected to Renan. The young Goldziher had contemplated converting to Islam. It was in the hope of seeing Judaism raise itself to the high spiritual and moral level of Islam that he eventually decided not to do so.</p>
<p class="para">In this introduction, I have sought to present, in a rather impressionistic way, a series of examples showing how ancient Christianity must also be understood from the viewpoint of the history of religions in late antiquity. Prophecy runs like a thread from Jesus to Muhammad. And yet, this thread, arguably the single most important characteristic of the Abrahamic movement, often remains outside the mainstream, hidden, as it were, since it generates heresy. The figures of the Gnostic, the holy man, and the mystic <span id="page_19"></span>are all sequels of the Israelite prophet. They reflect a mode of religiosity which is characterized by high intensity. It is centrifugal by nature and emphasizes sectarianism and polemics, esoteric knowledge, or <i class="calibre1">gnōsis</i> and charisma. The other mode of religiosity, obviously much more common than the first one, is centripetal. It favors an ecumenical attitude, contents itself with a widely shared faith, or <i class="calibre1">pistis</i>, and reflects, in Weberian parlance, the routinization of the new religious movement. This is the mode of priests and bishops, rather than that of martyrs and holy men. These two main modes of religiosity, high versus low intensity, exist simultaneously, and cross the boundaries of religious communities. They offer a tool permitting us to follow the transformations of religion in late antiquity in general, and in ancient Christianity in particular, without becoming prisoners of the traditional categories of Patristic literature. Through the dialectical relationship between these two modes of religiosity, one can follow the complex transformations of ancient Christianity in its broad religious context.</p>
<p class="para">Christianity, which had started as a Jewish heresy, soon turned the tables and made the Jews into the first Christian heretics, who had rejected the correct understanding of their own scriptures. This transformation would be completed in the sixth century with Justinian’s legal measures, which transformed the Jews into a community (or more precisely, a web of communities) of tolerated heretics. The “cunning of reason,” to use Hegel’s pregnant coining, would then see the early Muslims apply this approach to the Christians themselves. Under the Caliphate, the Christians would also become a community (or a web of communities) of tolerated heretics, who, like the Jews, had purposefully distorted the one, true message of God, first proclaimed by Abraham and last retrieved by Muhammad.</p>
<p class="para">Part <a href="part0009.html#acprof-9780198738862-part-1" class="calibre3">I</a> of this book will seek to identify some of the major transformations of religion in late antiquity, beyond the boundaries of traditional religious communities. It will focus on the implications of the progressive disappearance of blood sacrifices and will ask whether we may speak of “patterns of rationalization” in the various forms of late antique religiosity. Part <a href="part0012.html#acprof-9780198738862-part-2" class="calibre3">II</a> will deal with the perception of prophecy in late antique Christianity. In particular, we shall analyze the concept of “false prophecy” in contexts of heightened eschatological expectations, for instance, in the early seventh century, as well as that of “Seal of Prophecy” as it appears already in early Manichaean traditions. My contention is that, in parallel to the formation of orthodoxies, major underground currents kept alive the revolutionary and centrifugal power of prophecy in late antique religion. Part <a href="part0016.html#acprof-9780198738862-part-3" class="calibre3">III</a> will study aspects of the complex relationship between Jews and Christians in late antiquity. It will also reflect upon the new perceptions of political power in a monotheistic climate. Finally, Part <a href="part0019.html#acprof-9780198738862-part-4" class="calibre3">IV</a> will highlight the interplay of some of the themes studied here with the coming of Islam.</p>
<p class="para">The four parts, then, seek to follow the trajectory of some major themes in late antique religion up to the emergence of Islam. Obviously, many themes of <span id="page_20"></span>importance could not be dealt with here. I am thinking, in particular, about early Christian Docetism, a conception which reappears in the Qur’an, and about aspects of Christian martyrdom in the Roman Empire, which bear upon the early Islamic idea of martyrdom. The evolution and interplay of mystical traditions among Jews and Christians, in particular the vision of God, too, and their impact upon early Islamic conceptions, again, could not be dealt directly here. It is my belief, however, that these would not have altered in major ways the kind of trajectory delineated in this essay.</p>
