<p class="parafl">Let us note right away the profound difference that exists between the modern study of Jews and Arabs in Antiquity. Ethnic and religious identity, which was relatively weak among the Syrians, for example, was very pronounced <span id="page_176"></span>among the Jews, who made a point of preserving their national identity in a cosmopolitan world, despite the loss, in the first century, of all political power and the destruction of the central symbol of their religion. In addition, research on the Jews is far more advanced than that on pre-Islamic Arabs or Christians, who unfortunately have stirred too little interest so far. What justifies a comparison between the perception of Jews and Arabs is the fact that these were two groups of people who, although certainly very different from one another, shared the common character, from the seventh century on, of being neither Christians nor polytheists.</p>
<p class="para">As I hope we shall see, the juxtaposition of late antique and early Byzantine attitudes to Jews and Arabs might shed light on some fundamental ambiguities in early Byzantine consciousness and on the semantic evolution of a few major concepts through which identity, both ethnic and religious, was defined. More precisely, I shall seek to understand a little better the ways in which the concepts of “heresy” and “barbarism” played a role in the perception of both Jews and Arabs. My purpose here is to try to take apart the mechanisms, or at least some of them, which determined how outsiders were perceived in the Christianized Roman world. It is, I think, partly because of the very fact of the remarkable linguistic continuity of the Byzantine Empire that certain major transformations of collective identity, and hence of the perceptions of “the other” (<i class="calibre1">l’autre</i>), remain concealed and need to be unveiled. James Howard-Johnston has rightly noted that we should never underestimate ideological inertia in the life of states and nations. More precisely, he insists on the fact that the Byzantines did not only consider themselves to be the inheritors of the Roman Empire: they thought of themselves as Romans.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-3" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a> This is also what they were called in other languages, a fact reflected in both Arabic and Hebrew sources. In the same volume, Cyril Mango calls attention to the Byzantine perception of the various Christian heresies as reflecting Satan’s many manipulations, adding that the Empire considered its principal task to be the guardianship of correct ideology.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-4" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> Both are right, of course, and the Byzantines were that oxymoron: Romans enrolled in a cosmic fight against the devil. Évelyne Patlagean was quite aware of this oxymoron. In her own words, “the accent is put on Christianity, as the carrier of the universal values of <i class="calibre1">Romanitas.</i>”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-5" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> If ideological inertia can go hand in hand with radical transformations, <span id="page_177"></span>the major concepts with which the Byzantines both identified themselves and perceived outsiders could become quite inadequate for dealing with a changed reality, as Mango argued long ago. In this regard, following the sociologist Ann Swidler, I propose to see in the major concepts with which ethnic and religious identities are built and perceived repertoires of sorts, or “toolkits” of habits, skills, and styles from which strategies of action are constructed.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-6" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> Societies, just like individuals, make use of the cultural tools they inherit, but these are not always entirely adequate for the new tasks expected of them in changing conditions. In such conditions, tensions, ambivalences, and contradictions develop. In the case of the Christianized Roman Empire, as we shall see, the problem is compounded by the fact that both as Romans and as Christians, the Byzantines retained sets of quite different concepts. They did not keep these sets of “toolkits” separate, but used them together, creating new, complex categories, which we will try to deconstruct. The situation is even more complicated: while the Byzantines were politically and culturally Romans, religiously they were Hebrews (in their own mind they were, actually, the real Hebrews, <i class="calibre1">verus Israel</i>, as they alone correctly understood the scriptures and prophecies). And, of course, linguistically, they were Greeks, a fact at once trivial and highly problematic, as “<i class="calibre1">Hellēn</i>,” for Christians, referred to pagans, polytheists.</p>
<p class="para">From the earliest times on, the twin terms <i class="calibre1">Hellēn/barbaros</i> had continually undergone semantic shifts of various kinds, a fact well studied in the <i class="calibre1">longue durée</i> by Albrecht Dihle.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-7" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> As far back as the earliest social groups, collective identity had always been represented in terms of a dichotomy between the self and the other. From Hellenistic times onward, contacts between the ethnicities, cultures, and religions of the Mediterranean and Near East became so complex that there ensued a series of transformations, sometimes radical, of the key concepts in ethnological designations.</p>
<p class="para">Before we discuss early Byzantine ethnological categories, we must go back to earlier strata of Christian literature and to the formative period where these categories were first established, a time when Christians were still outlawed, if not persecuted, and long before they became proud Romans. The scriptural foundation upon which Christian ethnological categories were constructed was without a doubt Colossians 3: 11: “Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but <span id="page_178"></span>Christ is all, and is in all.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-8" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> Thus, from the very outset Christians inherited Jewish categories, even though they rejected them: for the Jews, humanity was divided into Jews and non-Jews (<i class="calibre1">goyyim</i> [peoples] in Hebrew, translated as <i class="calibre1">ethnē</i> in the LXX). For the Jews of the Hellenistic world, these <i class="calibre1">ethnē</i> were the Greeks, <i class="calibre1">Hellēnes</i>, a word which became equivalent to pagans.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-9" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> Hence, there existed for the early Christians a double distinction, the Greek one between <i class="calibre1">Hellēnes</i> and <i class="calibre1">barbaroi</i>, on the one hand, and the Jewish one, between <i class="calibre1">Hellēnes</i> and <i class="calibre1">Ioudaioi</i>, on the other. Moreover, as followers of the Law of Moses, a text originally redacted in Hebrew, even Hellenophone Jews considered themselves, and were regarded by the Greeks, as followers of a <i class="calibre1">philosophia barbaros</i> (a wisdom written down in a foreign language, as Clement of Alexandria, following Philo, termed the Torah).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-10" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In an early study of early Christian ethnological representations, I asked how Christian intellectuals in late antiquity perceived the different peoples with whom they were in contact, and whether they succeeded in establishing their own ethnological categories, distinct from those they had inherited from the Hellenistic and Roman worlds.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-11" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a> The only answer I reached in regard to this question was disappointing. Admittedly, Christianity was conceived and presented, from its earliest beginnings, as a new truth open to all peoples and translatable into any language, accessible to all cultures. However, it would only be with the Spanish <i class="calibre1">frailes</i>, missionaries to the New World at the start of the modern era, that a truly ethnological approach, in the vein of Herodotus, a real effort to understand cultures in their own terms, would come to light.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-12" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> It seems that the very ecumenical ambitions of the Christians blunted or even neutralized their ability to develop a real ethnological curiosity and to discern the distinctive qualities of the various peoples. After all, these peoples had all been, before their conversion, pagans. And paganism, in its many garbs, was of no intellectual interest whatsoever, as it <span id="page_179"></span>was established upon falsehood. The same truth had been offered to all. Religious truth, the saving incarnation of God’s Son, was the only thing that mattered. Truth remained one, while multiplicity was a sign of error. Yet, it would seem that the early Christian thinkers, followers of a “barbarian philosophy,” should have developed at least a tacit sympathy for the barbarian nations outside the Hellenic cultural realm. Certainly until the fourth century, some Christian authors, at least, saw themselves both as followers of a “barbarian philosophy” and as being ethnic “barbarians.” Thus Tatian, in his <i class="calibre1">Address to the Greeks</i>, written towards the middle of the second century, proudly presents himself as an “Assyrian.” As such, he perceives himself as a barbarian <i class="calibre1">in bonam partem</i>, who rejects the false wisdom of the Greeks, while possessing a better, “barbarian” kind of wisdom. In a similar vein, Rufinus, at the very start of his <i class="calibre1">Ecclesiastical History</i> (a text written in the late fourth century) proudly describes how Christianity was introduced to the Armenians, the Ethiopians, the Iberians (or Georgians), and the Saracens (or Arabs), in compliance with the evangelical injunction: “Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-13" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Indeed, Christians, even in the Christianized Roman Empire, while politically and culturally Romans, retained some “barbarian” traits in their identity. First, they were heirs to the Jews and thus guardians of that barbarian wisdom par excellence, the Bible, a book written in Hebrew, even if read in Greek translation. And what a translation! The Greek of the Septuagint cannot, any more than that of the New Testament, be seriously considered as the polished, elegant, even sublime language one expects of a book of wisdom, especially one that claims to have been divinely revealed. Early Christian writers proudly accepted the charge leveled at them by pagan writers, such as Celsus, of being simplistic, of lacking intellectual sophistication. The very linguistic rusticity of the Christian scriptures answered the accusation: if these were written in a language of fishermen, it was precisely because they were intended to bring salvation to all in equal measure, illiterates and philosophers alike. Thus Christians, aware of being marginalized by the intellectual elites, accepted this fact, identifying with a wisdom that was foreign to that of the Greek philosophers, and was therefore barbarian.</p>
<p class="para">The absolute legitimacy of translating the scriptures became a tenet and fact of Christianity (though not of the other two Abrahamic religions), and is thus part of the legacy of early Christianity. All is translatable: divine revelation is entirely within the realm of prose, not of poetry, as the Greeks would have it. For Christians, it was the Greek philosophers, the old pagan elites, who had to be discredited and toppled from their pedestals by the followers of the new barbarian philosophy. But the issue was more complicated, as <span id="page_180"></span>Christians were not simply another barbarian people. They lived among Greeks and barbarians alike, without quite belonging to them. Christians, therefore, were not like any other people. They represented a people of another order, between Greeks and Jews, a third kind of people famously called in the <i class="calibre1">Epistle to Diognetus</i>, in the second century, <i class="calibre1">triton genos</i> (<i class="calibre1">tertium genus</i>). The Syriac theologian Aphrahat, often called “the Persian Sage,” would speak, in the fourth century, of <i class="calibre1">‘ama de-‘amame</i>, a people issued of peoples. Despite both their vituperative argument with the Jews and their ecumenism, Christians refused to relinquish the historical, geographical, and ethnic roots of their religion, and insisted on seeing themselves as the legitimate successors to Israel: <i class="calibre1">verus Israel</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-14" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> Constantinople, therefore, would be the new Jerusalem as much as the new Rome. Only the Manichaeans would bring to its radical consequences the Marcionite tendency to give up completely on the Jewish dimension of Christian identity.</p>
