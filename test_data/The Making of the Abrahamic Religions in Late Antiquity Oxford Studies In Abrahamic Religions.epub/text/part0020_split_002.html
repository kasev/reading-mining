In 1833, the young Abraham Geiger published his monograph on Muhammad’s Jewish sources, <i class="calibre1">Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?</i> Geiger insisted on Midrashic traditions, the traces of which can be discovered in various sūras. Geiger’s central idea, the deep impact of some Jewish traditions on the Qur’an, was generally accepted by Orientalists. This acceptance stands in stark contradistinction to his perception of Jesus as having been close to the Pharisees, an idea which all Christian theologians rejected with deep horror (one of them, the Hebraist Franz Delitzsch, wrote that calling Jesus a Pharisee was “ten times worse” than the crucifixion). A long list of (usually Jewish) scholars familiar with rabbinic literature has pursued research following in Geiger’s footsteps. It is mainly thanks to the great Orientalist Theodor Nöldeke (who was very impressed by Geiger’s book) that research looked for the Christian sources of Islam. For Nöldeke, Islam actually represented the Arabic form of Christianity. The learned Swedish bishop Tor Andræ would pursue Nöldeke’s research, insisting on the fact that the Christian orthodox traditions are not the only sources reflecting the Qur’an’s background and that one should not forget Jewish-Christianity (or Manichaeism, for that matter) as possible roots of Qur’anic doctrines. Such an approach is still favored today by scholars such as Günter Lüling or Christoph Luxenberg, for whom the source of the Qur’an (the <i class="calibre1">Ur-Koran</i>) is to be found in Syriac Christian hymns (Arian for Lüling).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-13" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a> Research still does not seem to have àreally rephrased the problem and continues to oscillate between Judaism and Christianity in order to understand the birth of Islam better.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-14" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_145"></span>In 614 the Byzantine Empire had suffered a humiliating defeat by the Sasanians. Yet, this was only the foretaste of the amputation of much of its territory a few decades later with the Islamic conquests. Tensions ran high and the heightened expectation of the <i class="calibre1">Endzeit</i> encouraged a renewal of an apocalyptic mode of thought.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-15" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a> Eschatological <i class="calibre1">furore</i> was as alive among the Jewish communities as among the Christian populations. For the Jews, however, the interpretation of coming events was strictly the opposite of that of the Christians: the Antichrist, with the violent tribulations expected by the Christians (before Christ’s return in glory), was the Jews’ Messiah.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-16" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a> For both Jews and Christians, the eschatological expectations were anchored in a long tradition, but this tradition had become blurred or neutralized in the course of the centuries (for Christians, mainly since the Constantinian revolution). And yet, eschatological expectations had never quite disappeared. Rather, they had become an underground stream, ready to reappear in times of dramatic events.</p>
<p class="para">The conquest of Jerusalem and the capture of the Holy Cross in 614, which represented for the Byzantines a true military, political, and religious catastrophe, were perceived by Jews as a messianic promise.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-17" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a> We have learned to recognize the centrality of Jerusalem for the earliest stages of Islam. Some indications suggest that the military defeat of the Byzantines and the Muslim conquest of the Holy City were perceived by the Jews as signs that the messiah and the end of times were near. For the Jews, the Muslim conquerors could have appeared as announcing the Messiah. Indeed, it seems that the early architectural activity of the new masters of the Temple Mount—for them, <i class="calibre1">al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf</i>—was interpreted by Jews as announcing the coming of the <i class="calibre1">Endzeit</i>. It might even have been perceived in that way by the Muslims themselves, as suggested by Andreas Kaplony, in his detailed study of the Islamic sources.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-18" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_146"></span>In the last generation, and in particular since the publication of Peter Brown’s <i class="calibre1">The World of Late Antiquity</i> in 1971, late antiquity is no longer defined only by the joint presence of pagans and Christians in the Roman world. In a number of aspects, the Islamic conquests retained the cultural traditions of the Roman Empire. In addition, Greek remained the administrative language under the early Ummayads. Hence, historians now commonly agree that late antiquity continues at least until the end of the Umayyad period.</p>
<p class="para">In parallel to the extension of the chronological limits of late antiquity, we can witness today the extension of its geographical boundaries. In particular, we have learned to recognize that the Arabian Peninsula, considered earlier to have been located on the margins of the <i class="calibre1">oikoumenē</i> and to have played a rather limited historical and cultural role, must now be seen as an integral part of the world of late antiquity. This is particularly true, in our present context, in the realm of religious ideas and practices. Robert Hoyland, who has significantly contributed to a better knowledge of the complex religious milieu of earliest Islam, has referred to late antique Arabia as a “laboratory” for observing the transformation of religious traditions, the end of paganism, and the birth of Islam.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-19" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In order to understand in what sense Arabia can be called a laboratory for religious change, one can refer to Max Weber. For Weber, it was not by chance that the prophets of Israel belonged to a marginal society, outside the main political, economic, and cultural centers of the ancient Near East. For him, it was precisely the relative distance from those centers that made possible fruitful exchanges between periphery and center, as well as the birth of new forms of cultural and religious expression. According to Weber, the creative tension permitting the birth of such new forms demands some distance between two societies, one of which is to an extent dependent upon the other. This distance, however, should not be too great, lest it prevent cultural communication.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-20" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> <i class="calibre1">Mutatis mutandis</i>, late antique Arabia is like ancient Israel: in permanent contact with the great political centers of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East, as well as with the religious trends throughout the region.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-21" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> From the 570s and the Sasanian conquest of Yemen, Arabia was practically surrounded by the Persians. Under such conditions, the slow but clear religious evolution at work since Hellenistic times, from polytheism to monotheism, had a powerful impact upon the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_147"></span>We now know that at the end of the sixth century Arabia had become, as it were, a major meeting place in the Near East, between the Sasanian and the Byzantine empires as well as Axum’s Christian kingdom.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-22" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> In Arabia, monks, dissidents, missionaries, soldiers, refugees, and merchants, all facilitated, inter alia, the free circulation of religious ideas.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-23" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a> From the last years of the sixth century, Arabia absorbed the repercussions of the conflict between the two empires.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-24" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> It is probably in the context of the eschatological tensions mentioned on p. 145 above that one should understand what Christian Robin has called the “prophetic movement” in early seventh-century Arabia. As Robin has also noted, new epigraphic discoveries reflect the religious crisis long undermining traditional beliefs in Arabia.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-25" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a> Many opted for a form of monotheism, but the precise nature of this monotheism escapes us, although it seems to have followed “Jewish” patterns. Iwona Gadja has been able to show how a similar kind of monotheism developed in Ḥimyar, in the cracks as it were, between Judaism and Christianity as their believers vied for power.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-26" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Our knowledge of the presence of Jewish and Christian communities in Hijaz, in Western Arabia, is very limited. There are no remaining imprints of Christian communities north of Yemen. François Villeneuve writes that in Arabia Christianity never succeeded in getting a foothold south of Aqaba.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-27" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-27" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">27</sup></a> Moreover, the testimonies regarding the existence of Jewish tribes in Ḥijāz do not enlighten us on the nature of their Judaism, although some clues would point to Jews coming from Palestine.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-28" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a> Even if one can detect the impact on <span id="page_148"></span>earliest Islam of some ideas originating in the Sasanian realm,<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-29" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a> the Qur’an clearly points to the fact that the main religious trends underlying Islamic monotheism come from Jewish and Christian milieus.</p>
<p class="para">Reading the Qur’an in the light of late antique literature, as Angela Neuwirth proposes, is meaningful only if it is made clear that what is meant is Jewish or Christian late antique texts.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-30" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a> Classical <i class="calibre1">paideia</i> and the Greek philosophical tradition, which are of crucial importance in late antiquity, will have a major impact on Islamic culture, but only later, in Abbasid Baghdad. Even if limited to its Jewish and Christian expressions, however, late antique culture in the Near East offered a rich gamut of exegetical possibilities. All sectarian and hermeneutical trends stemming from the foundational texts of Jews and Christians must therefore be studied together. These include not only the various Jewish-Christian groups as mentioned by the Christian heresiologists, such as the Ebionites, the Nazoreans, or the Elchasaites, but also Gnostic and Manichaean dualists and also the “noble” heresies of the Monophysites and Nestorians, who together represent the majority of late antique Christians in the Near East, from Egypt and Syria to Armenia and Iran.</p>
<p class="para">In 1978, John Wansbrough published <i class="calibre1">The Sectarian Milieu</i>, a book in which he sought to identify, beyond the multiple communities in Arabia at the dawn of Islam, a conflict of hermeneutics and even a midrashic mythopoiesis, within which one should study the formation of the Qur’an.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-31" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-31" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">31</sup></a> Wansbrough’s approach had a powerful impact upon Patricia Crone, one of the two co-authors of <i class="calibre1">Hagarism</i>, a book published the preceding year.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-32" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-32" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">32</sup></a> <i class="calibre1">Hagarism</i> offers a fresh approach to Islamic origins, and establishes its argument solely on seventh-century sources, that is, mainly on Christian texts, while ignoring Islamic (Arabic) sources, all later, unless corroborated by other sources. To be sure, the reconstruction of Islamic origins thus obtained remains speculative, as the two authors willingly admit. Such a revisionist attitude, however, permits us to formulate anew the problem of Islamic origins within the frame of biblical hermeneutics among Jews and Christians.</p>
