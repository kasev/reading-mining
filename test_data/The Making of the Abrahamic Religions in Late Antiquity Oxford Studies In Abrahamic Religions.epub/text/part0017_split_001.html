<p class="parafl">Augustine called the Jews “our book keepers,” <i class="calibre1">librarii nostri</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-1" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> Beyond the reference to God’s revelation of the Scriptures to Israel, the expression emphasizes the fact that the deep, essential, and intimate relationship between Christians and Jews remained a concrete and permanent one at the turn of the fifth century. In the mid-sixth century, John of Ephesus, the leading Monophysite church historian and hagiographer, reports that a monk visiting a mountainous village east of the Euphrates asks the people he meets: “Are you Christians or Jews?”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-2" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> As this vignette shows, it was sometimes difficult to distinguish a Christian from a Jew in the late ancient Near East. Both could speak the same language and look the same. This was probably also the case all <span id="page_104"></span>around the Mediterranean: there was usually no clear-cut or visible differentiation between the two estranged communities. Both Augustine of Hippo and John of Ephesus testify to the state of affairs after the watershed of the fourth century, which had seen a radical reversal of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity.</p>
<p class="para">Indeed, the conversion of Constantine was only the prelude to other deep transformations of the relationship between Christians and Jews, up to the Muslim conquests. Before Constantine, while Judaism was a <i class="calibre1">religio licita</i>, the Christians had remained beyond the fringes of legality. Moreover, the last two generations of scholarship have radically shaken the old perception (nurtured by theological prejudice) according to which the Jews had begun a drastic process of social and intellectual seclusion after 70 <span class="sc">ce</span>, accelerated by the bloody revolts in Alexandria and then in Palestine during the early second century. Soon after Constantine, who reportedly described the Jews as “slayers of the prophets and killers of the Lord,”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-3" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a> things began to change. Throughout the fourth century, Christianity moved fast from being prohibited to being tolerated, then to preferred status, and eventually to state religion. At the same time, the Jews saw a series of grave infringements upon their rights and social status, limiting in drastic ways their integration into society. Judaism was now tolerated, at best, only because the Jews cherished the Old Testament (which, Christians said, they misread in some important ways). After 380, when Theodosius I published in Thessalonica his edict <i class="calibre1">Cunctos populos</i>, making Christianity into the state religion, the Jews became for all practical purposes second-class citizens, although they were not demoted from the status of <i class="calibre1">cives romani</i>. In a sense, they had become “<i class="calibre1">dhimmis” avant la lettre</i> (in 388, Theodosius prohibited marriage between Christians and Jews).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-4" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> Such a modicum of toleration, it should be noted, was offered neither to pagans nor to heretics. This process of segregation, to be sure, was not a straight line. John Chrysostom’s eight “<i class="calibre1">Sermons against the Jews</i>” of 386 were actually written not against the Jews, but as a direct rebuke of Judaizing tendencies amidst Antiochene Christians.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-5" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> To follow Harnack, the Jew appears here as a rhetorical device: it is the Jew as the Christian feared him. Indeed, the violence of these sermons shows the extent to which Judaism had retained its power of attraction at the end of the fourth century. It also echoes the fear this attraction <span id="page_105"></span>could generate, twenty years after the failure of Julian’s attempt at rebuilding the Jerusalem Temple. Chrysostom’s invectives are usually perceived as reflecting the last stage, as it were, of Judaism’s attractive powers. One should perhaps also question this view, and wonder whether the clear legal and social worsening of the Jews’ status necessarily meant the disappearance of the cultural interaction between Jews and Christians. We shall seek here to review some of the ways in which Jews and Christians interacted in the Christianized Roman Empire, as well as in the Sasanian Empire, where both were religious minorities.</p>
<p class="para">While the two communities were, of course, incommensurable in their numbers and legal status in the early Byzantine Empire, their common biblical heritage entailed what we may call a religious <i class="calibre1">koinē</i> of sorts and continuous exchanges that went well beyond religious polemics.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-6" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> The period under study saw the formation and crystallization of both Byzantine and rabbinic theology, and would prove crucial for the future of both religions. Yet studying primarily theology overlooks a number of historical complexities. Many of the cultural dialectics of these contacts are not specifically religious. Most Jews, like most Christians, were no theologians, and the study of religious dynamics must deal with the various ways in which they interacted, for instance, in language, folklore, or magic.</p>
<p class="para">The Islamic conquest must also be taken seriously. It would again change, in drastic ways, the terms of the relationship throughout the Near East and North Africa. From then on, both Jews and Christians shared, more or less, the same status as <i class="calibre1">ahl al-kitāb</i>, a religious community tolerated because it had a scripture. More precisely, one can perhaps claim that the emergence of Islam represents one result of the cultural dynamics between Christianity and Judaism. Muhammad knew elements of both Judaism and Christianity and rejected parts of these two religions as well accepting elements of both. In a sense, the very concept of <i class="calibre1">ahl al-kitāb</i> represents a broadening to Christians (and to Zoroastrians) of the Christian theological attitude toward Jews since the fourth century, while the imperial legislative limitations would be echoed in the Islamic concept of the <i class="calibre1">ahl al-dhimma</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-7" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> Even the Byzantine Empire’s definition of itself developed religiously and politically in relation to the emerging competitor to Christianity, Islam. Yet, the immediate counterpoint to Byzantine identity, at least from a religious viewpoint, remained the Jews, both in their present gloomy obstinacy and in the past glory of their sacral kingship.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-8" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_106"></span>A few caveats are in order. First, the two communities (or, rather, webs of communities) are far from being comparable by almost any criterion. While we remain ignorant about Jewish demography in late antiquity, Jews were much less numerous in the fourth century than they had been under the early Roman Empire (although they probably never represented a significant part of the overall population, as estimated by some).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-9" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The relations between Christians and Jews in antiquity are usually compared to those between Christians and pagans. The natural tendency is to focus upon the Roman Empire, forgetting that some important Christian communities (both Miaphysites and Nestorians) were present in the Sasanian Empire, and had some cultural visibility, as doctors (Nestorians in Gundishapur, for instance) and translators of Greek literature. They must have developed at least some contact with the Jewish communities there, sharing Aramaic as their common language. The chief significance involves the leading role of late ancient Jewish Babylonian communities in defining the religious identity of, and a cultural agenda for, the Jews in Palestine, as well as in the various diasporas, through their interpretation of normative rabbinic Judaism, which came to dominate Jewish life after the Islamic conquests.</p>
<p class="para">Jews and Christians were involved in a direct competition, leading at times to violent clashes, with both communities claiming the same inheritance. This fact draws attention to their polemics, to the conflicting side of their relationship, and obscures the important and many common aspects of their lives. By definition, polemical literature insists on what divides, ignoring the many points of agreement between two groups.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-10" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> To a great extent, however, the life of Jews and Christians, as well as of members of other religious communities, followed very similar patterns. What we may call the “common life,” <i class="calibre1">koinos bios</i>, of Jews and Christians in late antiquity is highly significant for a richer understanding of the cultural dynamics between them. Folklore provides an example. To a great extent, for instance, midrashic literature may be read as “tales of the neighborhood,” reflecting the common daily life and attitudes of Jews and Christians (and not only of them) in late antique Galilee.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-11" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a></p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-24"></span><span id="page_107"></span>
