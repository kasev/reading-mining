<p class="parafl">One can perhaps extrapolate, <i class="calibre1">mutatis mutandis</i>, from the few examples of contacts between mystical stances among Christians and Jews to other fields of cultural contact. Mystical experience, at least what we can know from our sources, was a matter for intellectuals, or at least religious virtuosi. Education, religious law, and theology are fields in which it is plausible to expect some kind of cultural dynamics between the elites of the two communities. Despite the deep lack of symmetry between them, stemming from the fact that political power was in the hands of the Christians, and from the lack among the Jews of priests and monks or nuns, interesting similarities can be observed.</p>
<p class="para">Polemics is perhaps even more difficult to use because we do not possess a single autonomous Jewish voice and what we hear from the Christians is usually what they like to say when they write against the Jews. In Babylonia, at least, the Jews had over the years established some kind of educational system (the <i class="calibre1">yeshivot</i>, or Talmudic academies), but this system was organized on principles greatly different from those of the Christian academies in the East, such as the one in Nisibis. The variance is due, essentially, to the lack of Greek philosophy in the literary canon of the Jews and to the huge contrast in the expression of theological thought that ensued. The two systems of theological education must have remained quite impermeable to one anotherâ€”except for Jewish converts to Christianity (we do not hear of any Christian convert to Judaism in our period). In the West, as well as in the East, the monasteries began to offer a parallel educational system, which gave up the grounding in the classical <i class="calibre1">paideia</i>. Without Greek philosophy, Jewish theology remained, to a great extent, implicit, and focused upon religious law. Christians, on the other hand, focused upon theological debate, usually linked to opposing heresies of all sorts, leaving law, mainly, to imperial legislation.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-35"></span>
