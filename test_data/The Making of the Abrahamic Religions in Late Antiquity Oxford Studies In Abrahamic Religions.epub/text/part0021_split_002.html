<p class="parafl">Moving between the Foundation Stone (<i class="calibre1">even hashetiyya</i>), the Holy of Holies, the Temple, Jerusalem, and the Holy Land, we have before us, as it were, a series of Russian dolls. All seem alike; all reflect the same sacred character. In order to understand more precisely the religious dimensions of the Temple Mount, we must also reflect upon the power encapsulated in the name of <span id="page_163"></span>Jerusalem in religious and cultural history and memory. Originally, to be sure, it is from the Temple that Jerusalem received its sacred character. Later, however, the Holy City became emblematic of the sacred locus where the Temple had once stood and where it would eventually be rebuilt. It would be a mistake, therefore, to limit our inquiry to the Temple Mount itself, without calling attention to Jerusalem’s metaphorical dimension in cultural memory.</p>
<p class="para">The concept of cultural memory (<i class="calibre1">kulturelles Gedächtnis</i>) was developed, in particular, by art historian Aby Warburg between the two World Wars. In order to be really useful this concept should be connected to that of collective memory (<i class="calibre1">mémoire collective</i>), a term coined in the 1930s by French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-7" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> Any cultural memory, indeed, belongs <i class="calibre1">ipso facto</i> to collective memory.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-8" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> The early Christian thinkers whom we call the church fathers launched the process through which the name of Jerusalem was transformed into a major icon of Western cultural memory. This process was directly related to what Christoph Markschies has recently called its “devaluation” in early Christianity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-9" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> Cultural memory does not necessarily stand in contradistinction to religious memory, but rather to the radical intensification of religious feelings involved in eschatology.</p>
<p class="para">The earliest Christian attitudes toward Jerusalem seem to have been related directly to the millenarian or chiliastic view founded upon the announcement of Jesus’ reign of a millennium (<i class="calibre1">chilia etē</i>) in Jerusalem. Although this view was not the only one available (the African bishop Cyprian never mentions Jerusalem), it seems to have been dominant.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-10" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> As Ernst Käsemann put it, “Apocalyptics is the mother of Christian theology.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-11" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a> In the second century, Papias and Justin Martyr espoused millenarian views of this kind. Enthusiastic expectations of a return of Christ in glory (<i class="calibre1">parousia</i>) and a restitution of things past (<i class="calibre1">apokatastasis</i>) seem to have been inseparably bound up with the Christian faith down to the middle of the second century. This tendency was broken <span id="page_164"></span>only by Marcion; Marcion’s opponents, such as Irenaeus, returned even afterwards to broaching the end of time.</p>
<p class="para">Can we detect the mechanism by which such eschatological views were contested and so ceased to prevail in the mainstream tradition? Marcion, a contemporary of Justin in the mid-second century, rejected the Old Testament (as well as major parts of the New Testament), arguing that Christianity was a religion of a new kind and possessed no Jewish roots. He seems to have been the first opponent of chiliastic ideas in early Christianity. As Stefan Heid has shown, the argument over millenarianism in the second century was directly related to the controversy between Jews and Christians.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-12" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> The Jewish wars, especially the revolt launched by Bar Kokhba in 132–35 <span class="sc">ce</span>, form the background to this controversy and to the debate over millenarianism and the role of Jerusalem. For most church fathers, the Holy Land remained the land of the Jews and a reconstruction of the Temple meant a Jewish victory, at least from a spiritual perspective. Indeed, expectations of this kind were to be found among the various Jewish-Christian groups, such as the Ebionites, for whom the rebuilding (<i class="calibre1">restitutio, apokatastasis</i>) of the Temple was a central eschatological belief.</p>
<p class="para">Marcion rejected all that, including beliefs in the eschaton and about the role of Jerusalem at the end of time. For him, such beliefs were simply irrelevant to the Christian faith. No wonder Irenaeus—for whom Marcion, along with various dualist and Gnostic thinkers, was the archenemy—insists precisely on eschatology. Deservedly called “the theologian of chiliasm,” Irenaeus is the greatest writer on eschatological Jerusalem. The last chapters of his magnum opus, <i class="calibre1">Against the Heresies</i>, are devoted to the battle between Christ and Antichrist that was to precede the reign of Christ in Jerusalem, waged up to the destruction of the Temple. Eschatology is the principal insurance against the metaphorization of Christian beliefs; it possesses an irrevocably concrete element.</p>
<p class="para">It is no accident that Tertullian, the late-second and early-third-century North African church father who first established the antinomy of “Athens versus Jerusalem,” eventually joined the ecstatic and prophetic Montanist movement. For the followers of Montanus, in the second half of the second century, a new prophecy, delivered to women, announced the imminent descent to earth of the Heavenly Jerusalem.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-13" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a> Montanism, then, exhibits with particular clarity the direct connection between the role played by (heavenly or earthly) Jerusalem at the end of time and the intensity of eschatological expectations.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-14" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_165"></span>The Christian idea of <i class="calibre1">translatio Hierosolymae</i>, the holy city’s travel in space, seems first to appear with Montanus, who, according to Eusebius, “gave the name of Jerusalem to Pepuza and Tymion, which are little towns in Phrygia.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-15" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a> As confirmed by Tertullian, who had inside knowledge of Montanist beliefs, this probably meant that the heavenly Jerusalem was seen as having descended upon Pepuza and Tymion. The heretical status of the Montanists in the third century and the Christian invention of the Holy Land in the fourth century probably forestalled the implantation of <i class="calibre1">translatio Hierosolymae</i> in patristic literature. Nevertheless, this concept never quite disappeared. Throughout Christian history, it emerged as an expression of sectarian eschatology in such phenomena as the Hussite reconstitution of the Holy Land in fifteenth-century Bohemia, the Taborites’ Tabor, and the expectations of the New Zion sectarians in nineteenth-century Russia for the descent of the Heavenly Jerusalem.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-16" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">If the New Jerusalem can descend from heaven onto Pepuza, a small town in Asia Minor, who needs the city of David anymore?<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-17" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a> Indeed, new Zions exist in various cultural surroundings. A famous case is that of the churches carved in the rock in Lâlibalâ, in Ethiopia.

<p class="para">The failure of early Christian apocalyptical movements, illustrated by the perception of the Montanists as heretics and the postponement to the end of days of Christ’s Second Coming, his <i class="calibre1">parousia</i>, had direct implications for representations of Jerusalem. Rather than alternative earthly locations, or the idea of an eschatological <i class="calibre1">renovatio</i>, it is the metaphor of a <i class="calibre1">spiritual</i> Jerusalem that was to become prevalent in the early Christian mind. This Jerusalem was the Christian’s true fatherland and it was in heaven—from which, according to Rev. 21: 2, the New Jerusalem was to descend. In this regard, the early Christian writers were following in the footsteps of Jewish apocalypticism. <span id="page_166"></span>In IV Esdras, a Jewish text redacted at the end of the first century <span class="sc">ce</span>, the eschatological element is still prominent: Jerusalem would be established by God in the messianic era.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-20" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> The Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch weakens this element by describing the heavenly Jerusalem as having been prepared by God at the origin of the world, thus pointing to the direct relationship between the origins of the world and the end of time.</p>
<p class="para">The transformation of the ideal city is completed in the late second century with Clement of Alexandria, who recalls that the Stoics referred to the heavens as the true city.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-21" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> For him, as a Christian, the obvious parallel to the heavenly city of the Stoics was the heavenly Jerusalem, which he calls “my Jerusalem.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-22" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> We touch here on the roots of Jerusalem’s mystical meaning. Origen takes up and develops Clement’s views on the holy city (<i class="calibre1">polis</i>). Jerusalem, whose Hebrew name (<i class="calibre1">Yerushalayim</i>) is interpreted as meaning “vision of peace” (<i class="calibre1">yir’e shalom</i>), can mean the Church, but also, in the tropological sense, the soul.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-23" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a> A similar allegorical interpretation appears in the writings of the fourth-century Origenist, Didymus the Blind. For him, too, the significance of Jerusalem is threefold: it is at once the virtuous soul, the Church, and the heavenly city of the living God. We shall return to the “vision of peace” (<i class="calibre1">visio pacis</i>) metaphor of Jerusalem, which runs as a thread through the centuries.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-24" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> One further formative metaphor stems directly from Paul: the supernal Jerusalem, mother of the Christians, is also called <i class="calibre1">eleuthera</i>—free (Gal. 4: 26).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-25" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">For Marcion and the Gnostics, the whole Jewish heritage was a stumbling block on the way to a fully emancipated Christianity. The Gnostics did not need Judaism’s traditional eschatological expectations, since they claimed to live in the redeemed time of “realized eschatology.” In their struggle against such objectors, various church fathers after Irenaeus were led to insist, precisely, upon the hopes of Christ’s <i class="calibre1">parousia</i> and the last and decisive battle between the forces of good and evil. But such hopes were also those of Jews and of Jewish-Christians, with whom the same church fathers were also <span id="page_167"></span>engaged in intense competition about the proper understanding of the scriptures.</p>
<p class="para">Thus, with regard to Jerusalem, two distinct phenomena can be observed in early Christianity. The first is the distinction, made more and more clearly with time, between the earthly and the heavenly Jerusalem. This distinction, which, again, is of Jewish origin, received a new impulse in early Christian writings, already with Paul. The two Jerusalems became completely disconnected, as they never had been in Jewish writings. The earthly Jerusalem remained identified, essentially, as the city of the Jews, who had killed Christ and whose Temple had been destroyed in divine punishment. This Temple would not be rebuilt. “And I saw no Temple in it”—that is, in the New Jerusalem come down from heaven—says the visionary in the Apocalypse of John, the most topical of all early Christian eschatological texts (Rev. 21: 22). The heavenly Jerusalem soon became a metaphor for the community of the saints, or the “city of God” in Augustine’s parlance. It was invested with all the dreams and qualities attributed to Jerusalem in eschatological thought, but very little remained here of the original meaning of the name.</p>
<p class="para">The Augustinian typology of the two cities has its roots in Tyconius, whose <i class="calibre1">Commentary on the Apocalypse</i> referred to two cities, Babylon and Jerusalem.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-26" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a> For Augustine, Babylon represents power and politics, while the heavenly Jerusalem—of which he sings, “Quando de illa loquor, finire nolo” (“When I speak of her, I don’t want to stop.”)<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-27" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-27" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">27</sup></a>—represents the Church, the Bride of Christ. Babylon refers to life in the present, in this world, Jerusalem to the future life, in which the boundaries of time will be overcome and God will be praised forever, <i class="calibre1">in saecula saeculorum</i>. The major formative influence of this typology on medieval perceptions needs no further stressing.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-28" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The second phenomenon is the weakening of eschatological beliefs, expressed in the progressive erosion, from the second to the fourth century, of the expectation of Christ’s second coming. As it became more and more difficult to maintain intensive hope of an imminent advent, the acme of the <span id="page_168"></span>Christian message became clearly entrenched in the past. With the fading of its future, Jerusalem itself, a small, marginal city in the Empire with the forever destroyed Temple and Golgotha at its heart, was bound to lose almost all significance. Paradoxically, the less important the city of Jerusalem became, the more the name “Jerusalem” seemed to gain in evocative power. Late antique Christianity, indeed, bequeathed the overwhelming resonance of Jerusalem to European culture, eastern and western. Jerusalem was now Rome: in the words of Jerome, “Romam factam Hierosolymam.” It was also Byzantium; Constantinople is often called “the second Jerusalem,” while Moscow, later, would become “the third Jerusalem.” The whole world would eventually become Jerusalem. This is literally true in the <i class="calibre1">Commentary on the Apocalypse</i> written in the fourth century by Victorinus of Poetovio (Ptuj in present-day Slovenia): at the end of time, Jerusalem will expand and cover the face of the earth.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-29" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a> Similar conceptions appear in rabbinic literature as well.</p>
<p class="para">In both the fourth and the sixth centuries, major architectural achievements sought to offer new, Christianized versions of the old Jewish Temple. Eusebius, Constantine’s panegyrist, described the Basilica of the Anastasis as “the new Temple,” while Justinian, upon entering the newly built Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, allegedly declared: “I have surpassed thee, O Solomon!”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-30" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">It is traditionally assumed that, by the fourth century, the chiliastic trends so prominent in the early stages of Christianity had more or less burnt themselves out; yet, they seem to reappear with renewed strength in the seventh century, with the same old scenario being played out in Jerusalem, in particular around the Temple Mount. Indeed, the seventh century, a period of dramatic religious and political transformations in the Near East, has long been recognized as a time when eschatological beliefs were particularly activated in the Byzantine Empire.</p>
