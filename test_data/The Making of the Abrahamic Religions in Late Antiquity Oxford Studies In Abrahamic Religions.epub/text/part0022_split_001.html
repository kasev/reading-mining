There seems to be little in common between Jews and Arabs in late antiquity. The linguistic similarities between Hebrew and Arabic would not be discovered (and the category of Semitic languages would not be invented) before Leibniz, in the seventeenth century. The Jews shared the Bible (more precisely, the books of the Old Testament) with the Christians, while the Arabs, usually perceived as utter barbarians, nomads stemming from the desert, had very little in common with the Christians. I shall deal here with perceptions both before and after the battle of Yarmuk and the Islamic conquest of Jerusalem (in 636 and 638 respectively), which provided, of course, the main watershed in Byzantine attitudes to Arabs.</p>
<p class="para">As we saw in <a href="part0014_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5" class="calibre3">Chapter 4</a>, the ecclesiastical historian Sozomen (born <i class="calibre1">c</i>.400 in Bethelia, near Gaza), tells us about various Judaizing practices, such as circumcision and a prohibition on eating pork, among the <i class="calibre1">Sarakēnoi</i>. The origin of such practices, he adds, would come from the recognition of their kinship with the Jews, through their common ancestor Abraham.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-1" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> As shown by Fergus Millar, such a new image of the Arabs in late antiquity stemmed from Josephus’s perception of the Ishmaelites.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-2" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a></p>
