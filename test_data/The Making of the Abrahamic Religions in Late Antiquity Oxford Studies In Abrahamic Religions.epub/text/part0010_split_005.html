<p class="parafl">The end of sacrifices as a central and public religious practice in late antiquity led to a major crisis in the conception of ritual purity. Since the prophets of Israel, through Jesus and Mani, the value of the ancient ways of re-establishing ritual purity had been seriously questioned.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-30" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a> The abandonment of the temples, and often their destruction through fits of iconoclastic violence, raised other questions regarding religious identity, which had usually been centered around shrines. Traditionally, temples had been built on central, clearly visible places, either within or without cities. Now the <i class="calibre1">oikoumenē</i>, the inhabited world, was being emptied of its temples, as it were, and in their place, churches were being built. They were built in the place of temples, but not always quite on the same sites. Various studies of the transformation of the urban texture in late antiquity show that churches were much more dispersed, in the different neighborhoods of cities, and not necessarily at their centers. Moreover, in most religious cults of the ancient world, the ritual was usually performed in the open, and in public (Mithraic cult represents here a striking exception), while synagogue and church ritual were almost only performed inside, for the community of the faithful. A central aspect of this ritual was the reading, singing, translating, and commenting of scriptural passages, a fact that imposed a closed building, usually of rather limited dimensions. The new forms of ritual entailed, then, new forms of cultic buildings. Such concrete transformations of religious life, and the new importance of religious communities, permit a better understanding of the nature of the changes than E. R. Dodds’s talk about a new spirituality.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-31" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-31" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">31</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">
<span id="page_39"></span>While Christian authors usually insisted with pride upon the novelty of their religion, this novelty was precisely what the traditionalists feared most. Thus, Emperor Julian expressed his wish to avoid novelty altogether, but in particular in the religious domain. But this very expression of his fear reflects the fact that such deep changes were precisely occurring at the time. While civic rituals, by definition open to all, were meant to reaffirm collective identity, the new forms of identity that were becoming prevalent were by nature religious, and open only to members of the community—in contradistinction to society at large.</p>
<p class="para">As argued by John Scheid, a deep transformation of religious practice had occurred in Rome, starting at the end of the civil wars, and growing with Roman expansionism and under the Empire. With the growth of the cities, the direct participation of all citizens in the cult was eventually made impossible, and the cult became the business of their representatives. Hence, a more abstract religion, which had not yet changed in nature, became more internalized: for many, religious participation was now intellectual, done through reading. Scheid, who sees here a <i class="calibre1">praeparatio evangelica</i> of sorts, suggests a parallel with the Jewish communities from the diaspora, which had learned to function without the Jerusalem Temple.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-32" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-32" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">32</sup></a> This is certainly true, although one should be careful not to overemphasize the differences between the Jewish communities in Palestine and in the diaspora. The term “scriptural communities,” coined by Brian Stock to describe medieval phenomena, is applicable in the ancient world to philosophers and Jews alike. Such communities were found in Palestine as well as in the diaspora, around the <i class="calibre1">batei midrash</i> (“study halls”) and the synagogues, where the scriptures were interpreted. Psycho-sociological analysis, then, can bring us to a better understanding of the nature of the new religiosity emerging in the Roman Empire. The forms of ritual were focusing on the scriptures, which were to be read and interpreted, and offered the basis for calls to personal repentance from sin.</p>
<p class="para">Already in the second and third centuries, the willingness of urban elites to retain the traditional values of the old civic model began to be questioned. In the fourth century, these elites too often showed no real interest in exercising their political duties. Together with the slow depopulation of the cities, this trend helps to explain the growth of religious communities. Such communities, to be sure, had existed for a long time. But under the Empire, in particular from the third century, what John North, using a metaphor borrowed from Peter Berger, has called “the supermarket of religions” offered multiple possibilities for a religious identity freely chosen. Garth Fowden, for his part, <span id="page_40"></span>argues that the broad acceptance of such conceptions of communitarian identity became characteristic of late antiquity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-33" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-33" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">33</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In Rome, religion had meant, almost exclusively, the observance of the ritual. Questions of truth were quite absent from the religious sphere. In order to understand the transformation of such a conception into that of Augustine, for whom <i class="calibre1">vera religio</i> represents, first of all, an internalized phenomenon, we must recognize the inversion of the relation of two pairs of notions: sacred versus profane, and public versus private. As both Cicero and Marcian tell us, religion, or the sacred, was in Rome essentially a public affair. What remained private was categorized as profane. With the internalization and individualization of religion, the two pairs would become inversed. Among both Jews and Christians, the field of the sacred was identified with the private domain, while the public domain remained essentially profane. This was certainly the case until the fourth century. With the progressive, but rapid, Christianization of the Empire, things changed, and religion (i.e., “orthodox” Christianity) sought to reclaim the public sphere. From Constantine to Theodosius II, religion eventually became an affair of state again, and received all the attributes of civic religion in ancient Rome, but with a twist. As the principle of religious authority was now rooted in personal conscience, and religion identified also with truth, the rejection of the right path (i.e., the interpretation of religion adopted by the Emperor) would have immediate and radical consequences.</p>
<p class="para">Since Gibbon, various explanations have been offered to the rise of religious intolerance and violence (two different but connected phenomena) in the world of late antiquity. As such violence and intolerance were mainly the work of Christians, it is either in the nature of Christianity (i.e., its origins in Jewish exclusiveness) or in its history (i.e., in the collusion, not before the fourth century, between state and church) that the roots of Christian violence and intolerance have been sought. It seems to me that both approaches err in their static character: they are unable to account for the deep transformation of mental patterns within Christian communities from the first to the fourth century. Early Christian communities, which remained <i class="calibre1">entpolitisiert</i> in the strongest sense of this Weberian expression, could, like the Qumran community, develop freely, upon a radical interpretation of their scriptures, some violent ideas about the <i class="calibre1">Endzeit</i> and the final eschatological war. The trouble began when they were suddenly put in a position of power. Most were unable to realize at once that the new political fortune demanded a new hermeneutics. <span id="page_41"></span>As we know too well, similar phenomena are known elsewhere, also in contemporary history.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-34" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-34" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">34</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In order to understand the growth in religious intolerance and violence in late antiquity, one must recognize the new fact of an identity defined, more than ever before, in religious terms. People now perceived themselves as belonging to a freely chosen community. While Jewish exclusiveness made space for non Jews (for instance as “God fearers,” fellow travelers of sorts, or as “pious among the nations”), Christian universalism could not easily tolerate outsiders. By definition, such outsiders were heretics, pagans, or Jews. Only the last could be, to a certain extent, tolerated on the fringes of society. With time, these fringes had a tendency to shrink. As we have seen, Justinian cannot tolerate their use of Hebrew anymore, and in the early seventh century, forced baptism is demanded in the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p class="para">Jews and Christians knew exactly the stakes of the conflict between them, and the rules of the game (true prophecy and the correct understanding of their common scriptures). Between Christians and “pagans,” on the other hand, a <i class="calibre1">dialogue de sourds</i> was soon established. On both sides, it seems, there was a total lack of understanding of the nature of the other side’s religion. Both Christians and “pagans” sought to understand one another in their own terms. From one of the most impressive intellectual testimonies to this conflict, Origen’s <i class="calibre1">Contra Celsum</i> (a text written around the mid-third century), at least, it would appear that the main argument between them focused on the idea of civic religion, or of the relationship between state and religion.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-35" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-35" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">35</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">To the extent that it claimed to be the sole representative of true prophecy, Islam was similar to Christianity. But its success in transforming the community of the faithful (the <i class="calibre1">umma</i>) into imperial society (a transformation probably due mainly to the fast pace of the Arab conquests) permitted Muslims to set a relationship between state and religion that ever evaded Christian rulers, East and West.</p>
