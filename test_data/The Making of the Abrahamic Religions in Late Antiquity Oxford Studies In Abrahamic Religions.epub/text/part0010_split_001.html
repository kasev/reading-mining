<p class="parafl">At the onset of <i class="calibre1">The Origin and Goal of History</i> (<i class="calibre1">Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte</i>),<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-1" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> the German philosopher Karl Jaspers highlighted the fact, already noticed in the eighteenth century, that approximately around the mid-first millennium <span class="sc">bce</span>, a series of exceptional figures appeared in a number of civilizations, which had a dramatic impact on thought and religion. Confucius and Mencius in China, the Buddha in India, Zarathustra in Iran, the prophets of Israel, and the Ionian Presocratic philosophers all transformed the cultures in which they were born in radical ways. (Zarathustra’s dates are anything but certain. He may well have preceded the axial age by a few hundred years.) <span id="page_24"></span>Jaspers was fascinated by this seeming synchrony, which he could not really explain. For Jaspers, the axial age constituted the great divide in human history. Civilizations before and after it were different in some fundamental ways. In Jaspers’ perception, civilizations that had no obvious contacts between them underwent, at more or less the same time, which he called <i class="calibre1">Achsenzeit</i> (axial age), a spiritual “quantum leap” which introduced self-consciousness and gave an ethical dimension to myths and to the perception of the universe. Through the spiritualization that this transformation involved, the axial age established the grounds on which the great historical religious and intellectual traditions emerged. In 1975, Jaspers’ insight was picked up, as it were, by the participants of a special issue of <i class="calibre1">Dedalus</i>, the journal of the American Academy of Sciences, edited by the American Sinologist Benjamin Schwartz. The interest in the axial age gathered momentum with <i class="calibre1">The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations</i> (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1986), a book edited by the leading Israeli sociologist Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-2" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> The current trendiness of the axial age is perhaps best highlighted by the publication, in 2006, of Karen Armstrong’s <i class="calibre1">The Great Transformation: The Beginnings of Our Religious Traditions</i>. More recently, the late sociologist of religion Robert Bellah published his magnum opus, <i class="calibre1">Religion in Human Evolution: From the Paleolithic to the Axial Age</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press, 2011). In this book, he dealt successively, with the civilizations of Israel, Greece, China, and India around the middle of the first millennium <span class="sc">bce</span>. Bellah’s study of the transformation of religion in the axial age in his last book had been anticipated by a seminal article.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-3" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The idea of the axial age, with its undertones of a scholarly approach emphasizing the spiritual unity of humankind and deep similarity between the “great civilizations” and their intellectual and spiritual heroes is easily seductive. According to Eisenstadt, the main axial transformation was the birth of cultural “reflexivity” and of “second order thought.” Thanks to the chasm that had opened between the heavenly world and the human realm, axial-age cultures learned to express discursively their own cosmology and anthropology. This chasm also had another impact on religion, which now entailed a demand for salvation.</p>
<p class="para">Eisenstadt and Bellah saw themselves as walking in Weber’s footsteps when they sought to compare ancient civilizations. Weber’s Sisyphean attempt at highlighting the main articulations of societies, economics, and religious views, <span id="page_25"></span>from a comparative perspective, an attempt that was cut short by his death in 1920, remains to this day the most impressive and sustained effort to analyze religions in the context of the different societies in which they were born and grew, and the dialectical relationship between religion, economy, and society.</p>
<p class="para">Like Durkheim, Bellah conceives the stages of religious development as following the evolution of societies moving from the less to the more complex. This Durkheimian trope is compounded by a Darwinian one: human evolution also belongs to the evolution of a species. Societies move from the simplest structures (the tribe) in the early stages of human history to more and more complex ones: the city, the early state, the empire. The transformations of society are accompanied by transformations of ritual and myth, of religion. “As societies became more complex, religions followed suit,” writes Bellah, indicating that such transformations are not linear. They are mainly accomplished through mutations, radical structural changes which appear to be the answer to crises and challenges. The axial age, he argues, witnessed a major crisis in the ritual system, as people stopped believing in the system’s efficacy. Bellah can thus speak about a burst of “anti-ritualism,” and of “demythologization” (Bellah uses here, in a new fashion, a concept coined by the theologian Rudolph Bultmann, referring to the mental activity necessary for a modern apprehension of the New Testament). To be sure, anti-ritualism does not entail the end of ritual, anymore than demythologization means the end of myth. It does point, however, to a new, critical attitude to traditional ritual, as well as to the new central importance of ethics in religion—hence, the new universal dimension of religion. It is only with the break of former ritual systems that major breakthroughs could open new vistas in religious attitudes and beliefs.</p>
<p class="para">The fascination with the axial age reflects the similarity of intellectual and spiritual trends and culture heroes, across civilizations seemingly unrelated. This concept is a perfect antidote to accusations of Europeocentrism in an age of globalization. The problem is that the axial age seems to be a <i class="calibre1">fata morgana</i>. The riddle of synchrony, as Jan Assmann has argued, evaporates at the mention of Akhenaten, Jesus, or Muhammad, who should obviously belong to the club of “axial” figures together with Socrates, Isaiah, or Zarathustra. While it sometimes happens that different cultures reach a similar turning point at approximately the same point in time, what really counts, in each case, is the cause (or causes) of this turning point. Moreover, the obvious possibility of diffusionism should be entertained: if chariots and goods could move so easily, ideas could too. But religious change can also be brought about by new technologies. The clearest case is probably that of the emergence and diffusion of script systems. The development of writing, which is directly related to the establishment of empires and huge, centralized societies, entailed the need, for the literate elites, to educate and train new generations of scribes, and eventually the redaction of books, and hence of holy texts, which often remained <span id="page_26"></span>esoteric, not to be divulged to all and sundry. Religion inscribed in a book has become a portable religion, one that can and will travel. On various occasions in his book, Bellah points to the crucial importance of writing in the evolution of cultures, but fails to grant the topic all the focused attention it requires.</p>
<p class="para">The concept of axial age, then, is misleading. Rather than focusing on one epoch when everything, everywhere, tipped over, it is probably wiser to identify major cultural changes, whenever they happen. New configurations of culture and their social consequences are just as interesting as new configurations of society and their cultural consequences. We are the recipients of the double legacy of Greece and Israel. This may very well be the case, but it is only through the major intellectual remodeling effected by the church fathers (and before them by Philo of Alexandria) and of the medieval Scholastic theologians (who could read Aristotle mostly thanks to the Arabs!) that these two legacies were integrated.</p>
<p class="para">Religions should be studied in their different societal and cultural contexts. If there is no single <i class="calibre1">homo religiosus</i>, from all times and all cultures, as the phenomenology of Mircea Eliade wanted us to believe, that does not mean that there is no common ground between the rituals and myths of all nations. And if the axial age proves to be an illusion, that does not mean that religions, like societies, do not undergo at some turning points in history some major transformations, or even mutations. Analyzing such mutations in a comparative perspective, dismantling their inner mechanisms, is not merely possible. It is the key to a better understanding of the very nature of religious revolutions, past and present.</p>
<p class="para">The challenge is how to dissolve false categories without giving up on the grand ambition to find laws; that is, to retain the principle of unity beyond diversity—and what else is science, what else is scholarship? If the idea of the axial age fails to convince, it is not because there is “nothing in it,” but because it is less unique and less universal than it claims to be. Rather than one single axial age, one might then prefer to speak of a number of axial periods, in each cultural “ecosystem”—while it is possible, of course, to identify also some synchronic similarities between different cultural ecosystems. The longer late antiquity, for example, is such a period for the cultures of the Near East and of the Mediterranean. From Jesus to Muhammad, a series of religious movements (together with the Christians, one should mention, at least, the rabbinic Jews, Gnostics, Manichaeans, and Mandaeans) insist on the redaction and preservation of holy, revealed books. These books, which are often learned by heart, at least in part, are commented upon, sometimes translated, often sung during ritual. One can speak of a “scriptural movement” in the late antique Near East and Eastern Mediterranean. It is essential to understand how this new role played by books will soon transform the religious systems of the area, ushering in new configurations from the old building blocks. These new religious configurations, namely Eastern and <span id="page_27"></span>Western Christendom, as well as the Islamic Caliphate, will soon form an “eco-system,” which will endure throughout the Middle Ages. And since in late antiquity the religion of biblical Israel underwent a series of dramatic transformations with the rabbis, it is what we have recently learned to call the Abrahamic religions that the axial age” ignores. In this “ecosystem,” religious and cultural trends will constantly circulate and evolve, creating the basis of our world. These reflections on the idea of an axial age are meant to cool unleashed enthusiasm, as tempting as it may be, for seeing in late antiquity, or in any other given period, a time of dramatic cultural, intellectual, and religious transformation in many highly different societies. Hence, the following pages do not claim a global heuristic value, beyond the Mediterranean and Near East. While it may be far-fetched to speak about an axial age, the search for similarities and parallel developments in distinct civilizations, which do not have much interface, can certainly lead to interesting or even important conclusions about the mechanisms through which civilizations undergo deep transformations.</p>
<p class="para">A series of major political, cultural, and social changes affected all aspects of life in the Near East as well as around the Mediterranean under the Roman Empire. Religious beliefs and attitudes, in particular, underwent some dramatic transformations. Indeed, those scholars who, rejecting the Gibbonian paradigm of decline and fall, have taught us to look at the Roman Empire in the <i class="calibre1">longue durée</i>, as a time when new cultural frames were developed, have all insisted on the religious dimensions of late antique creativity. Each in his own way—Henri-Irénée Marrou, E. R. Dodds, Peter Brown, Robin Lane Fox—has been able to speak of the <i class="calibre1">religious revolution</i> of late antiquity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-4" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> One might argue that our period is no less crucial for future developments than the <i class="calibre1">Achsenzeit</i> identified by Karl Jaspers with the middle of the first millenium <span class="sc">bce</span>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-5" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> In order to do justice to the dramatic nature of the transformations in our period, from, say, Jesus to Muhammad, one can also speak of “religious mutations.” By borrowing this metaphor from the field of biology, I intend to highlight the fact that we do not only witness the passage from paganism to Christianity (to follow the traditional perception), or that from polytheism to monotheism. Rather, I wish to claim that we can observe nothing less than a transformation of the very concept of religion. To encapsulate the nature of <span id="page_28"></span>this transformation, one may perhaps speak of “the end of sacrifice,” in reference to the fact that at the time of Jesus, religion meant, for Jews and Greeks alike, the offering of sacrifice, while the situation had changed in some radical ways in the sixth century. But the multifaceted nature of this revolution encompassed other areas than the ritual and its transformations. One can also observe a series of transformations: of psychological conceptions, of the place and role of books in religious life, and the passage from an essentially civic to a mainly communitarian nature of religion.</p>
<p class="para">One question that has often been asked is that of the nature of these transformations: are they Christian by nature, or do they rather reflect the zeitgeist? Such a question, it seems to me, is fundamentally flawed. The kind of Christianity (or Christianities) that emerges from our period is not quite identical to the Christian beliefs of the early church fathers, and reflects itself the evolution of Christian beliefs and praxis during those centuries.</p>
