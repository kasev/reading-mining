<span class="title">OXFORD STUDIES IN THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS</span>
</h1>
<p class="seriespara1">This series consists of scholarly monographs and other volumes at the cutting edge of the study of Abrahamic religions. The increase in intellectual interest in the comparative approach to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam reflects the striking surge in the importance of religious traditions and patterns of thought and behavior in the twenty-first century, at the global level. While this importance is easy to detect, it remains to be identified clearly and analyzed, from a comparative perspective. Our existing scholarly apparatus is not always adequate in attempting to understand precisely the nature of similarities and differences between the monotheistic religions, and the transformations of their “family resemblances” in different cultural and historical contexts.</p>
<p class="seriespara2">The works in the series are devoted to the study of how “Abrahamic” traditions mix, blend, disintegrate, rebuild, clash, and impact upon one another, usually in polemical contexts, but also, often, in odd, yet persistent ways of interaction, reflecting the symbiosis between them.</p>
