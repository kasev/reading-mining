<p class="parafl">Although we cannot go back to the religion of the “historical” Abraham, we know the concept of Abraham’s religion well from the Qur’an: “And who has a better religion than one who submits himself to God (<i class="calibre1">aslama wağhahu li-Illāhi</i>), does right and follows the true religion of Abraham the perennial believer (<i class="calibre1">millat Ibrāhīm ḥanīfan</i>)? God has taken Abraham for a friend (<i class="calibre1">wa-attakhadha Allāhu Ibrahīma khalīlan</i>).” (Qur’an 4: 125). For the Qur’an, there is only one religion of Abraham and it is Islam: “Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but a perennial believer and a Muslim (<i class="calibre1">ḥanīfan musliman</i>)” (Qur’an 3: 67). For the Qur’an, both Jews and Christians seek to claim that Abraham, the first true believer in God’s unity, belongs only to their own respective communities, although their sacred texts, the Torah and the Gospel, are later concoctions that cannot testify about Abraham’s original religion.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-11" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">This vision of things is very well known, of course, but I wish to call attention to the fact that it does not appear first in the Qur’an. Justin Martyr wrote his <i class="calibre1">Dialogue with Trypho</i>, it seems, about a decade before his death in 150, two generations after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, perceived by Christians as the divine punishment for the Jews’ refusal to recognize Jesus as Messiah. Whether the text is based upon a real dialogue or not is irrelevant here. Justin Martyr complains about Jewish accusations identifying Christianity as an “impious heresy.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-12" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> To be sure, the rabbis could call the Christians heretics (<i class="calibre1">minim</i>) without considering them to be Jewish. The accusation of heresy referred to the Christian self-identity as <i class="calibre1">verus Israel</i>. Such a self-identity, however, prevented seeing in them simply yet another kind of pagan. Hence stems the fundamental ambivalence, between a heresy and a religion, of the Jewish perception of earliest Christianity.</p>
<p class="para">To a great extent, the <i class="calibre1">Dialogue with Trypho</i> will set the main parameters of the whole genre of <i class="calibre1">Adversus Judaeos</i> literature from patristic times on. In Justin’s text, the figure of Abraham plays a major role in the dispute between Christians and Jews. Justin uses two different and, to some extent, contradictory lines of argument. On the one hand, he insists on the fact that Christians are the spiritual race of Abraham. On the other hand, he points out that, through Mary, Jesus Christ belongs to the biological offspring of <span id="page_194"></span>Abraham. Almost at the start of his book Justin states that the Christians are the true, the spiritual Israelite race (<i class="calibre1">genos</i>), that of Abraham and of the other patriarchs.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-13" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a> Yet he also insists, on three different occasions, upon the fact that the Virgin Mary comes from the offspring of Abraham. Her Son, then, “was born of a virgin of the race of Abraham.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-14" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> Mary belongs to Abraham’s “race,” writes Justin.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-15" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a> What Justin wishes to establish here is the fact that Christian universalism can be expressed through the concept of the true Israel. The Christians are a people, indeed, the true people of Israel, and they will inherit God’s promises made through Christ.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-16" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a> The circumcision and then the sabbath, the festivals, and the sacrifices were given as so many signs (<i class="calibre1">sēmeia</i>) because of the Israelites’ hardened hearts. All these Israelite rituals were provisional and became obsolete with the coming of Christ. Abraham himself did not need such signs, as he was still uncircumcised when he was justified and blessed, because of his faith in God.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-17" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a> The Jews err when they claim to be Abraham’s children. Only those Jews who will repent, finally recognizing the true meaning of the prophecies and the Torah, will inherit together with the Christians.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-18" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">This conceptual framework, established in the very first patristic so-called “Dialogue” with the Jews, would remain valid throughout the centuries. It represents the core of the conflict between the Church and the Synagogue. What is most significant from our perspective is the fact that for Justin, and for the patristic tradition after him, Christians are the true followers of Abraham’s religion, a religion from which the Jews have deviated. According to the Qur’ran, the Jews and then the Christians had deviated from Abraham’s true religion, which was reinstated by Muhammad’s community of believers. This conception, as I argued in <a href="part0017_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7" class="calibre3">Chapter 6</a>, is copied from the Christian one. The Islamic concept of “the peoples of the Book” (<i class="calibre1">ahl al-kitāb</i>) extends to Christians (and later also to Zoroastrians) the traditional patristic attitude to Jews.</p>
<p class="para">In the early fourth century, Eusebius of Caesarea, to give only one example, follows in Justin’s footsteps. He had argued at the outset of his <i class="calibre1">Ecclesiastical History</i>, that “it must clearly be held that the announcement to all peoples, recently made through the teaching of Christ, is the very first and most ancient and antique discovery of true religion (<i class="calibre1">theosebeias</i>) by Abraham and those lovers of God who followed him” (I.4.9–10). Regarding Abraham, he had just written that “the children of the Hebrews boast [of him] as their own <span id="page_195"></span>originator and ancestor (<i class="calibre1">archēgon kai propatera</i>)” (I.4.5). The obvious conclusion follows: it is the Christians, rather than the Jews, who are the true children of Abraham and who follow his religion, pure and original monotheism: “It is only among Christians throughout the whole world that the manner of religion which was Abraham’s can actually be found in practice” (I.4.14). Eusebius, then, argues that Christians, rather than Jews, are the real followers of Abraham’s pristine religion, a religion later “hijacked” by the Law of Moses, now obsolete. Here, of course, Eusebius follows Paul, for whom the Jews, by obeying the law of Arabian Sinai, are the spiritual offspring of Hagar (and hence of Ishmael), while the Christians are the true children of Sarah (Gal. 4: 21–31). For Eusebius, the Christians should “bypass” the Jews, as it were, and reclaim for themselves Abraham’s true religion, untainted by later additions.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-19" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a> We see now clearly that the Qur’an applies exactly the same logic also to Christians. The Gospel, just like the Torah, is a corruption of Abraham’s original religion: “O People of the Book (<i class="calibre1">Yā ahla al-kitābi</i>), why do you dispute concerning Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were only revealed after him? So you have no sense?” (Qur’an 3: 65).</p>
