<p class="parafl">Palestine, as we have already mentioned, constituted a special case. From the beginning, Christianization on the emperor’s direct orders had been particularly intensive there. In particular, geography had been modified through a series of churches that punctuated the landscape, defining it as a “holy land.” Places hallowed by the earthly presence of Jesus and of his mother, but also of the patriarchs, became landmarks which underlined that the “promised land,” (<i class="calibre1">terra repromissionis</i>) of the Jews, to use Jerome’s term, had now become the Land of <i class="calibre1">verus Israel</i>. This transformation of the land was visible in places such as Galilee or Hebron, but it was nowhere more obvious than in Jerusalem, a city from which Jews, who had been expelled by the pagan Roman emperors, remained officially excluded. One would have therefore thought that Byzantine Palestine would not be a place where Jewish culture could thrive. And yet, the evidence points to the opposite. Literary creativity produced an impressive series of works. The Palestinian Talmud (or most of it) was redacted in Tiberias during the fourth century. Some of the major works of midrashic literature, such as <i class="calibre1">Genesis Rabbah</i> and <i class="calibre1">Leviticus Rabbah</i>, stem from fifth-century Byzantine Palestine. The origins of synagogal poetry, the <i class="calibre1">piyyut</i>, are to be found there also. Yose ben Yose, the first <i class="calibre1">paytan</i> (from Greek <i class="calibre1">poiētēs</i>) whose name is known to us, for instance, lived in Palestine during the early fifth century.</p>
<p class="para">Jerome, who lived in Jerusalem and Bethlehem from the 380s until his death in 419, carried on in Palestine a dialogue that he had begun in Rome with rabbis and Jewish converts. His major interest in pursuing his contacts with Jews was intellectual in nature. First, he needed them as teachers of Hebrew, a language he never quite succeeded in mastering, despite his constant efforts. Secondly, he wanted to learn from them about various hermeneutical and exegetical traditions of the biblical text. <i class="calibre1">Hebraica veritas</i>: Jerome’s motto singled him out as a philologist in a world that did not particularly appreciate, or even understand, such an urge.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-19" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a> Indeed, his correspondence with Augustine reveals how the latter remained unable to understand Jerome’s efforts to <span id="page_113"></span>read the Bible in the original Hebrew. (Jerome appears here to be a lonely figure, also in his dealings with Jews, but he is following Origen, an earlier biblical exegete.) Jerome’s contacts with Jews, however, do not seem to have helped him develop any sympathy for them. Regular contacts, indeed, have never represented a panacea against ethnic, religious, or community tensions.</p>
<p class="para">Archaeological remains, which often reflect a more positive image of the interaction between communities than polemics, also reflect a blossoming of Jewish communities, groups that did not shun cultural influences from the surrounding world. Jews and Christians lived both in towns (except Jerusalem as a rule) and villages. In Tiberias, the seat of the Jewish patriarchs until 420, the spread of Christianity seems to have been inhibited for some time. The villages were often mixed, but there seems to have been a tendency toward separation between the communities in these villages. Synagogue mosaics from Byzantine Palestine, in particular, show an impressive ability to play with non-Jewish themes. While such themes are not directly Christian, it is highly plausible that they sometimes reflect use among Christians, hence echoing the polemical dialogue between the two communities. One instance may be the depiction of the <i class="calibre1">Akedah</i> on the floor of the Beit Alpha synagogue. The importance of Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac among Jews of late antiquity might well reflect its centrality among Christians, for whom Isaac (as well as the ram) was a <i class="calibre1">typos</i>, or <i class="calibre1">sacramentum futuri</i>, of Jesus Christ.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-20" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a></p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-29"></span>
