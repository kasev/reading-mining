<p class="parafl">The first centuries of the Roman Empire witnessed what is probably the most radical revolution in the history of the book until Gutenberg. This revolution has two aspects. On the one hand, the passage from roll to codex—a passage at first slow and gradual, from the first to the fourth century, transformed the very appearance and circulation of the book. This does not hold for Christians, however, as they adopted the codex almost instantaneously. On the other hand, the development of silent reading permits a new attitude to the book and its contents, and introduces a new, reflexive dignity of the single reader. In a sense, both transformations point to a privatization of reading, to a more personal, and less public, relationship between the reader and the text. Such a privatization would in its turn permit an almost unbounded spectrum of hermeneutical possibilities. Now when such a new approach to books is linked to the emphasis on a single corpus of texts ennobled as revealed scripture, it is easy to see the dramatic implications of this cultural revolution on religion itself.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-8" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In order to identify and highlight the common denominator of a series of religious trends from early Christianity to early Islam, the comparative historian of religion Wilfred Cantwell Smith has referred to “the scriptural movement” of late antiquity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-9" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> Indeed, a series of religious movements appeared in late <span id="page_31"></span>antiquity throughout the Near East and the Mediterranean that were all identified through their scriptures. While this view of things has much to commend itself, it does not tell the whole story. Indians and Orphics, for instance, had had a long tradition of sacred books, while both Jewish and Zoroastrian scriptures had been redacted much earlier. The Gathas seem to have represented, for perhaps as long as a millenium, a very special case of book: a book preserved orally, in a quite fixed form. (Similarly, the Qur’an seems to have existed, at least for some decades, only in oral form.) The Gathas would be put in writing only much later, after the Muslim conquest of Iran, when the Zoroastrian community was much weakened and fearing for its identity. For the rabbinic movement, a strong propensity to move away from the written text of the Bible to oral traditions (the Oral Torah, <i class="calibre1">torah she-be-al-peh</i>) can easily be detected in the first centuries of the Christian era.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-10" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> The writing phase among the Jews had taken place earlier, under the Second Commonwealth, when a plethora of works, eventually called pseudepigraphical and apocryphal books of the Hebrew Bible, had been written.</p>
<p class="para">Indeed, the library at Qumran seems to have been very significant. Calculations suggest that only in the ninth century would the library in the Sankt Gallen monastery have surpassed Qumran in the number of the volumes it held. Their relationship to books represents a major difference between Jews and Christians in late antiquity. Rabbinic Judaism seems to have been satisfied with one revealed book, commenting on it orally (in the Talmud and Midrash) and rejecting or ignoring all other books. Christians read their books mainly in order to follow Jesus Christ, the supreme exemplar, whose life (and death) one sought to imitate. For the Jews, there was no single biblical figure comparable to that of Jesus for the Christians. The Christians had offered a radical simplification of myth, while the Jews proposed a radical simplification of the notion of holy text. The Christian ideal of <i class="calibre1">imitatio Christi</i> permitted the development of a puzzling phenomenon: the saint, the holy man, would soon be described in terms of writing: he would himself be presented as a book to be deciphered, read, commented upon.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-11" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">A puzzling parallelism can be observed in the redaction and canonization process of the Mishnah and the New Testament. Both seem to have been edited at more or less the same time, from the eighties of the second century to the early third century. This striking fact has not really been explained. I suggest it reflects the result of the race, between the now distinct communities, throughout the <span id="page_32"></span>second century, to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Both communities sought to offer the correct interpretation of the same text (a text that Christians read in a [Jewish] translation): the Hebrew Bible. In a sense, one can claim that the Mishnah and the New Testament represent two different hermeneutical keys to the Bible. The Mishnah (in Greek <i class="calibre1">deuterōsis</i>, repetition) represents, just like the New Testament, the <i class="calibre1">kainē diathēkē</i>, the way through which the community can read and understand the true religious meaning of the Bible. The respective registers of the Mishnah and the New Testament, of course, reflect the deeply different religious structures of the two religions.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-12" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Among the new religious movements of late antiquity, Manichaeism is perhaps the most fascinating. One is dealing here with a strongly dualistic movement perceiving itself, from the start, as a world religion, based upon revealed scriptures. In various ways, Manichaeism appears as a radicalization of some trends already delineated in early Christianity, and also as a preview of characters usually identified with early Islam. When he invented, in 1873, the locution “religions of the book,” Max Müller was seeking to modernize and generalize an early Islamic conception. While the concept of “people of the book” (<i class="calibre1">ahl al-kitāb</i>) does not seem to appear before the Qur’an, Mani himself, around the mid-third century, was well aware of the various scriptural traditions of different religious systems. The first of the Manichaean <i class="calibre1">Kephalaia</i> represents in this regard an understudied key text. Mani lists various prophets—Jesus, Zarathustra, Buddha—who each made the mistake of not carefully committing to writing his oral teaching. The distortion of their respective teachings by their followers would be the unavoidable consequence of such a mistake. Therefore, Mani, in contradistinction to his predecessors in the long chain of prophecy, took great pains to retain a written version of his message. One can clearly see in this text a deep fear of falsifications of scriptures, a fear also reflected in Jewish–Christian traditions and in the Qur’an in regard to the Hebrew scriptures. What is peculiar to Manichaeism, of course, is the total rejection of the Jewish claims, a rejection reflected in the absence of Moses from the list of prophets.</p>
<p class="para">Manichaean rejectionism highlights the close connection, to be broken only by Marcionism, between Judaism and Christianity. Throughout their long polemics with the Jews in late antiquity, Christian authors were not able to deny the advantage of the Jews over them: only the latter could read their own writings in the original language. The church fathers perceived the Jews as <i class="calibre1">librarii nostri</i>,<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-13" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a> <i class="calibre1">custodes librorum nostrorum</i> as Augustine would call them.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-14" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> In 418, when Christians, encouraged by the local bishop, organized a <span id="page_33"></span>pogrom in Minorca, plundering Jewish houses and properties, they took great care of salvaging from the fire the Torah scrolls in the synagogue.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-15" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a> But the evidence is here too scarce to permit important conclusions. Another instance of the deep ambivalence toward the Hebrew scriptures is highlighted in Justinian’s <i class="calibre1">Novella</i> 146, dating from 553. Forbidding the cultic reading of the Bible in Hebrew, the Novella reflects the Emperor’s perception of the symbolic power that the Jews derived from their knowledge of the revealed scriptures’ original language.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-16" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Christians, who were not bound by cultural, religious, or linguistic traditions, offered a new attitude to religious language. For them the <i class="calibre1">traduttore</i> (translator) was no <i class="calibre1">traditore</i> (traitor). On the contrary, the idea of translation, from an archaic to a common language, understood by all and sundry, was of the essence of their religion. The ease with which Christians accepted, encouraged, and used translations of their scriptures has no parallel in the ancient world before the Manichaeans, who would even offer a more radical version of this approach. Their disregard for archaic language and hieratic forms of expression is also reflected in Christian polemics with Hellenic intellectuals about sublime language versus <i class="calibre1">sermo humilis</i>. Christian intellectuals insisted, against their Hellenic counterparts, that their religion was the same for philosophers and fishermen, a fact that explained and justified the Gospels’ low language. While Emperor Julian, in the second half of the fourth century, condemns and derides Christians for the mediocre literary level of their scriptures, his very polemics shows the extent to which even he was influenced by the Christian conception of scripture. To give another example, when Proclus, the leader of the Academy, states that he would seek to retain, of all books, only Plato’s <i class="calibre1">Timaeus</i> and the <i class="calibre1">Chaldean Oracles</i>, he too shows the deep influence of the concept of scriptures. Together with a marked lack of emphasis on the power inherent to original language, Christians, more than any other religious movement, were willing to reject the idea of an oral, esoteric tradition existing side by side with scriptures. This rejection, which fitted the ethos of Christianity as offering salvation equally to all, was certainly enhanced by the fight against such esoteric traditions embedded in Gnostic trends.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-17" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The Christianization of the Empire entailed the subtle transformation of the educational system. Before the end of the fourth century, Christians also <span id="page_34"></span>learned to teach those texts of Greek mythology to which they had been so vehemently opposed. Hellenic culture, then, would now be transmitted thanks to its former enemies, the Christians. In order to do this, Christian intellectuals were brought to apply to the Hellenic tradition too the set of hermeneutic rules they had developed in order to appropriate to themselves the Israelite scriptures. To borrow a metaphor invented by Crick and Watson to describe the structure of DNA, one could perhaps speak here of a “double helix.” Christian thinkers sought to find a series of similarities and parallels between the two cultural systems of Athens and Jerusalem. It is this double helix which stands at the root of Christian culture, which was first elaborated in late antiquity, and which informed European culture to modern times. Christian culture, then, constituted itself, both in the East and in the West, through slipping from biblical to cultural hermeneutics.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-18" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a> The monasteries are the <i class="calibre1">locus classicus</i> where this work on books was achieved. This was a complex effort involving reading, writing, and interpreting. The complex cultural system developed in the monasteries was based upon the central figure of Jesus Christ, through which all mythology revolved. Similarly, the libraries were built, as a whole, around one book of scripture, which contained, if properly understood, all secrets and all wisdom. Like the rabbinic sages who, borrowing the Greek concept of <i class="calibre1">paideia</i> (education), had transformed it into their central religious value, Christian intellectuals of late antiquity succeeded to a great extent in applying to the Greek intellectual tradition and to their own scriptures the same hermeneutical rules. In both cases, such attitudes entailed quite a new place and role for books in religious life and thought.</p>
