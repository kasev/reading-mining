<p class="parafl">In ancient Israel, as we learn from Max Weber, a major tension revolved around the Temple and its service.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-31" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-31" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">31</sup></a> The prophets’ charisma versus the priests’ routine: two radically different kinds of religious action confronted one another, one pushing for change, the other for stability. In the seventh <span id="page_169"></span>century <span class="sc">ce</span>, centuries after the destruction of the Temple, the very place where it had been built, its locus, seems to have been once more at the epicenter of a prophetic movement.</p>
<p class="para">At least from the conquest of Jerusalem by the Sasanians in 614 and the capture of the Holy Cross, the Christian world was rife with expectations of the <i class="calibre1">Endzeit</i>, with its traditional imagery of cosmic war between the forces of light and darkness. The Byzantines were slow to understand the true faith of the new conquerors, which they understood at first as being a new Christian heresy.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-32" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-32" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">32</sup></a> What would eventually settle into a centuries-long, deep-seated political and religious conflict, sometimes more overt and sometimes relatively dormant, started as a “big bang,” epitomized more than anything else by the conquest of Jerusalem by the Arabs in 638 and the ensuing dramatic changes in the city’s religious topography. Scholars have recently highlighted the centrality in these polemics of the Holy Land, the Holy City, and its core, the Temple Mount, as well as their direct impact on the earliest Islamic program in Jerusalem.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-33" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-33" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">33</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The Christians had relocated the sanctified locus from the Temple Mount, now barren, to the new Basilica of the Anastasis. The city’s Islamic conquerors, seeking to accomplish what we could call, in the Hegelian sense, an <i class="calibre1">Aufhebung</i> of both Judaism and Christianity, moved its sacred core back to the Temple Mount. As we saw in <a href="part0014_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5" class="calibre3">Chapter 4</a>, there is reason to believe that the early Muslim rulers intended to rebuild the Temple and even to install a kind of Temple ritual. This perception of things was also aimed at convincing the Jews that the end of time was drawing near and that the Caliph was the expected Messiah. In the Umayyad period, at least, the Temple Mount, not yet called <i class="calibre1">al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf</i>, was viewed both as the Temple rebuilt and as the mosque of Jerusalem.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-34" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-34" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">34</sup></a> If some Jews, however, might have been tempted to place the dramatic events in an eschatological perspective, they were soon disappointed. <span id="page_170"></span>For them, the construction of a new kind of temple in place of the old was perceived as no less an erasure of the Jewish dimension than the Christian dislocation of the sacred. Moreover, since the Anastasis remained standing, it would retain its sacredness (albeit lessened) under the Islamic regime.</p>
<p class="para">The new “clash of civilizations” between the Christian and the Islamic imperial states was nurtured in the cocoon of the Jewish–Christian clash of interpretations, which only superficially appeared essentially to reiterate, again and again, old arguments over a long-decided issue. The argumentation of these polemics, which centered upon the interpretation of biblical prophecies, revolved mainly around the image of Christ as the Messiah announced by the prophets of Israel. For Jews, the Messiah was yet to come; for Christians, he was to return in full glory and establish his kingdom, at long last, over all the earth. For the Chiliasts of the first centuries—most clearly exemplified, perhaps, by Irenaeus—Jerusalem, and in particular the Temple Mount, was to be the epicenter of the cosmic events that would occur at the end of time.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-35" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-35" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">35</sup></a> The debate focused on the inheritance of the Holy Land and the restoration to it of the Jews. Early Christian chiliastic expectations had very strong Jewish roots. In particular, as noted in <a href="part0014_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5" class="calibre3">Chapter 4</a>, the Antichrist is strikingly similar to the figure of the false prophet in the pre-Christian Jewish sources and was probably constructed from the latter.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-36" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-36" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">36</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">For Christians, the Messiah expected by the Jews would be the last impostor, the Antichrist. The Jews, on the other hand, believed that they were being ruled by believers in a false messiah.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-37" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-37" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">37</sup></a> With the violent conquest by the Persians and its deeply humiliating result, the exile of the Holy Cross, and then the new wave of successful invasion by the barbarian Arabs, the old questions were raised again, with a new urgency. These Arabs, streaming from their southern desert and claiming to follow the lead of their prophet—who could they really be, if not the powerful arm of the Jews, sent to reclaim their possessions in the Holy Land and the Holy City? Paradoxically, the great fear of the Christians had more to do with the shadow of the Jews than with the Arab invaders.</p>
<p class="para">Omar’s conquest of Jerusalem in 638 was bound to rekindle both the fears of the Christians and the hopes of the Jews and bring them to new levels of intensity. In the words of the seventh-century historian Sebeos, it appears quite clearly that the Jews began building a structure on the Temple Mount in the first years after the conquest:</p><div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">… the plot of the Jewish rebels, who, finding support from the Hagarenes for a short time, planned to [re]build the Temple of Solomon. Locating the place called Holy of Holies, they constructed [the Temple] without a pedestal, to serve as their <span id="page_171"></span>place of prayer. But the Ishmaelites envied [the Jews], expelled them from the place, and named the same building their own place of prayer. [The Jews] built a temple for their worship elsewhere.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-38" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-38" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre5">38</sup></a></p></div>
<p class="parafl">Apparently, the first Al-Aqsa Mosque was built only later.</p>
<p class="para">The Jewish sources from Arabia are scarce and difficult to interpret, but it seems that some Jews, at least, did at first see in Muhammad a messianic (or pre-messianic) figure. For Christians, on the other hand, the concept of “Messiah” was bound to remain quite puzzling, since <i class="calibre1">Christos</i> (a literal translation into Greek of Hebrew <i class="calibre1">mashiaḥ</i>, “anointed”) was, for them, the name of the Savior.</p>
<p class="para">In <a href="part0014_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5" class="calibre3">Chapter 4</a>, reference was made to the <i class="calibre1">Doctrina Jacobi</i>, a crucial Greek document dating from the very beginning of the Islamic conquests, in which the Jews considered Muhammad a false prophet (<i class="calibre1">pseudoprophētēs</i>). We also discussed the figure of the false messiah and of the false prophet as they appear in Christian and Jewish late antique texts, such as the Jewish <i class="calibre1">Apocalypse of Zerubbabel</i> and the Christian <i class="calibre1">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</i>. The latter, a fundamental witness to the eschatological perception of the Islamic conquest and a text that would become, in Latin translation, a major source of medieval eschatology, also mentions a false Messiah, <i class="calibre1">mashiḥa degala</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-39" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-39" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">39</sup></a> This <i class="calibre1">Degala</i> seems to be the source of the <i class="calibre1">Dajjāl</i>, the figure paralleling the Antichrist in Islamic eschatological texts. Moreover, as we saw in <a href="part0020_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9" class="calibre3">Chapter 8</a>, only Jewish-Christians, of all the various Jewish and Christian groups, conceived of the Messiah as a prophet. Moreover, some of their core religious beliefs, in particular their Docetism, are strikingly reminiscent of those of the Qur’an.</p>
<p class="para">In recent years, important epigraphic discoveries have transformed our perception of pre-Islamic monotheism in the Arabian Peninsula. It seems that the cross-fertilization of Jewish and Christian beliefs, the centrality of the Holy Land and in particular of the Temple Mount, and the eschatological expectations of both Jews and Christians should be perceived as the true prelude to Islam.</p>
