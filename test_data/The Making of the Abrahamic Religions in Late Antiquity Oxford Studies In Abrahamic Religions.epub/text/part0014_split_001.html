<p class="parafl">In the last chapter, we dealt with prophecy and false prophecy in early and late antique Christianity. We should now turn our attention to the religious scene in the East at the time of the birth of Islam. The early Christian figure of the Antichrist, like that of Christ, owes much to concepts current among Jews from before the time of Pompey. There remain early traces of the myth of a messianic opponent, which would remain active throughout the Roman period.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-1" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> While the birth of Christianity might well have been the most potent historical consequence of Jewish messianism, it was certainly not the last. Sometimes dormant, Jewish and Christian eschatological expectations never died out: Jewish messianic movements and Christian intense expectations of the <i class="calibre1">parousia</i>, or Second Coming of Christ, have punctuated the history of the two religions. In some cases, a combination of these two phenomena has had an explosive effect and some dramatic consequences. Such a combination occurred in seventh-century Palestine, and bears directly upon the earliest stages of Islam.</p>
<p class="para">The present chapter seeks to highlight some aspects of Jewish and Christian late antique eschatological conceptions, in particular the figures of the false prophet and of the false messiah. More precisely, it will focus on conflicting beliefs and expectations regarding the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="para">As in our own days, there existed in the seventh century a direct link between messianism and geopolitics.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-2" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> Of the two empires that clashed in <span id="page_74"></span>the early years of the seventh century, one would disappear before the end of the century, to be replaced by a new one. The Byzantines were able to understand the Islamic invaders only as the bearers of a yet unknown kind of Christian heresy—a view clearly expressed by John of Damascus, in the first half of the eighth century.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-3" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a> The fundamental difficulty Christian intellectuals experienced in trying to understand Islam on its own terms points to the fact that what we call today the “clash of civilizations” was also a conflict of interpretations within the monotheistic traditions. This conflict, however, was not simply one between Christians and Muslims; it also involved the Jews, who sat on both sides of the political, cultural, and linguistic divide. While we still do not know much of the state of affairs in Arabia, the importance of the presence of both Jews and Jewish religious ideas in pre-Islamic Arabia is now being recognized.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-4" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> It remains difficult to identify precisely the kind of Judaism involved, although it probably did not include only what we have learned to recognize as rabbinic Judaism.</p>
<p class="para">Prophecy was one of the central concepts over which polemics raged between the different groups claiming to possess wisdom and truth from divine revelation. For each group, the others’ claim to knowledge was a false one, as it was based upon false prophecy—a concept into which <a href="part0013_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4" class="calibre3">Chapter 3</a> delved.</p>
<p class="para">From the New Testament on, early Christian texts reflect a constant preoccupation with false prophets.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-5" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> As we have seen, it is for the Jewish-Christians, and in particular for the Ebionites, that the problem of false prophecy was of crucial importance in the economy of salvation.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-6" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">A conception remarkably similar to that of the Ebionites is found in a text from Nag Hammadi, the <i class="calibre1">Second Treatise of the Great Seth</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-7" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> In this text, Adam, then Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon, the twelve prophets, Moses, and John the Baptist, are called “laughing stocks” (<i class="calibre1">sōbe</i>), as they have been created by the Hebdomad as so many imitations of the true prophets. This text probably reflects the Gnostic reinterpretation of a Jewish-Christian theologoumenon.</p>
<p class="para">It is in this context that we must see the Christian perception of Mani, a false prophet and magician trying in vain to accomplish true miracles. For the <span id="page_75"></span>heresiologists, his very name reveals his folly, his <i class="calibre1">mania</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-8" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> The chain of the true prophets is indeed a Jewish-Christian theologoumenon, which is found also in the Manichaean conception of the succession of prophets from Adam to Mani. But, as we have seen, the Manichaean conception is more complex, as it involves a <i class="calibre1">double</i> chain of prophecy.</p>
<p class="para">After the Montanist crisis the possibility of Christian prophecy must have been much weakened, and relegated to heretical trends. Yet, the impressive resilience and continued impact of the topic of false prophecy shows that such movements were not quite marginalized. Since, for the rabbis, too, as we saw in <a href="part0013_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4" class="calibre3">Chapter 3</a>, the age of prophecy was officially closed, one finds in rabbinic as well as in patristic literature relatively few discussions on “the signs of prophecy,” the criteria which make it possible to distinguish between true and false prophets. Such discussions will become absolutely crucial in Islamic theological literature, as Muhammad is defined as a prophet.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-9" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> The main accusation against Muhammad, throughout centuries of Christian anti-Muslim polemics, in the Middle Ages and until early modern times, has always been the accusation of false prophecy: for both Christians (and also, to some extent, for Jews), Muhammad was an impostor, who succeeded in appearing as a prophet. As we shall discuss in <a href="part0015_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6" class="calibre3">Chapter 5</a>, Muhammad is identified not simply as a prophet, but as the seal of the prophets, the <i class="calibre1">khātam al-nabiyyīn</i>, in the Qur’an, and in early Islamic thought. It should be noted that this expression seems to have meant, originally, “confirmation” rather than “end” of prophecy.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-10" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> Actually, Muhammad is not the first to have used this expression, which already appears in Manichaean texts, where it is Mani’s disciples who are the “seal” of his prophecy, that is, its testimony and authentication.</p>
<p class="para">We have seen how the idea of true and false prophecy was absolutely central for Jewish-Christians. Indeed, for them (and, one must insist, for them only) there was almost an equivalence between the concept of prophet and that of messiah. We have known for some time that some Jewish-Christian groups remained in existence quite late, certainly in Palestine, until at least the eighth century, when John of Damascus, sitting in the monastery of Mar Saba in the Judean wilderness, testifies to their presence on the shores of the Dead Sea.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-11" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a> <span id="page_76"></span>Shlomo Pines, for his part, has argued for the presence of a Jewish-Christian community in Jerusalem during the reign of Mu’awwiyah.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-12" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The fact that these late Jewish-Christians might have been only small sectarian groups does in no way entail that they remained marginalized, having no impact on society at large. Warnings against Judaizing practices were common in seventh-century Christian literature, and might point to the continued presence and influence of Jewish-Christian groups. Thus, the <i class="calibre1">Doctrina Jacobi</i> reflects a preoccupation with Judaizers who observed the sabbath, as they were expecting the second coming of the Anointed One, that is, the Messiah (1.19).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-13" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a> It stands to reason, then, to postulate that they may have played some role in the polemic over true and false prophecy and messianism between Jews and Christians in the seventh century.</p>
<p class="para">As Pines has pointed out, for instance, Abu Isa al-Isfahani (d. ca. 750), a leader of a Jewish sect who led a rebellion against the Caliph ‘Abd al-Malik b. Marwan, was probably influenced in his self-conception by Jewish-Christian beliefs when he presented Jesus and Muhammad as true prophets.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-14" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> Pines then asks himself whether “the views held on the evidence of the <i class="calibre1">Doctrina Jacobi</i> at the time of the advent of Islam may be regarded as a form of reaction to this event or may have preceded it, and perhaps at some stage helped to shape the beliefs of the followers of the new religion.” He answers: “in our present state of knowledge, no conclusive answer to this complex of questions is possible.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-15" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a> A review of the evidence might shed some new light on the problem.</p>
<p class="para">Since at least the Iranian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 and the taking of the Holy Cross into captivity, both Jews and Christians in Palestine felt they were living in apocalyptic times. The apocalyptic trends of early Christianity, which had become dormant in the aftermath of the Constantinian revolution, were reactivated. The Christian world was rife with expectations of the end of times, with its traditional imagery of cosmic war between the forces of light and those of darkness. In Averil Cameron’s words, “Islam took shape within a context of extreme religious and cultural tension.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-16" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_77"></span>The new “clash of civilizations” between the Christian and the Islamic imperial states was indeed nurtured in the cocoon of the Jewish-Christian conflict of interpretations, which only superficially appear to repeat in essence, and ad nauseam, old arguments over an issue decided long previously. The argumentation of these early polemics centered on the interpretation of biblical prophecies, and revolved mainly around the figure of Christ as the Messiah announced by the prophets of Israel. For Jews, the Messiah was yet to come, while for Christians, he was to return, this time in full glory, and establish his kingdom, at long last, over the earth. For the chiliasts of the first centuries, perhaps most clearly exemplified by Irenaeus, Jerusalem, and in particular the Temple Mount, would become, at the end of times, the epicenter of dramatic events at the cosmic level.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-17" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a> The chiliastic debate that had raged in the first Christian centuries focused on issues of inheritance of the Holy Land and restoration of the Jews to their own land.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-18" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a> Early Christian chiliastic expectations had very strong Jewish roots.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-19" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">A comparative study of late antique Jewish and Christian eschatology remains a desideratum, which should emphasize the differences as well as the similarities between the two movements: indeed, the political situation of the Jews was vastly different from that of the Byzantine Christians. The former did not have anything to lose from the change of political and religious power, but they had much to gain and it was easier for them to bet on the new, previously unknown force. They could thus easily have placed their hopes of religious and political renewal in the Muslim conquerors.</p>
<p class="para">For Byzantine Christians, the Messiah expected by the Jews would be the last impostor, the Antichrist. From the fourth century on, Jews, on the other hand, held that believers in a false messiah ruled them. Victory for one side meant defeat for the other: a zero-sum game, in modern strategic terminology. The clearest expression of a Jewish vindication would be the re-establishment of the Temple. For Christians, such a threat was tantamount to the coming of the Antichrist, who had been described, in Irenaeus’s classic version of the myth (in the very last chapters of <i class="calibre1">Adversus Haereses</i>, book V), as well as in the slightly later version by Hippolytus, as establishing his throne, for three and a half years, until he would finally be defeated by Jesus Christ, in the Temple itself. For the Christian psyche, such a threat did not belong only to the ancient past. The memories of the great anxiety generated by Julian’s authorization to rebuild the Temple in 361, and the fact that work had actually started before a providential earthquake had <span id="page_78"></span>brought these efforts to naught, do not seem to have quite disappeared for a long time.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-20" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> In the seventh century, with the violent Iranian conquest and its deeply humiliating result for the Byzantines, the Holy Cross in enemy custody, and the new wave of successful invasion by the barbarian Arabs, the old questions were raised again, with a new urgency.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-21" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> Who could these Arabs really be, the Christians asked themselves, who stemmed from their southern desert, claiming to follow the lead of their prophet? Could they not really represent, in disguise, the powerful arm of the Jews, sent to reclaim their pretensions on the Holy Land and in the Holy City? Paradoxically, the great fear of the Christians had more to do with the shadow of the Jews than with the Arab invaders.</p>
<p class="para">The Byzantines were slow in understanding the true faith of the new conquerors. The Arabs remained for them, for too long, barbarians coming from the desert, and Muhammad was perceived as a false prophet whose faith could be understood only in the categories of Christian theology, namely as a heresy.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-22" href="part0014_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> What would eventually settle down, for centuries, as a deep-seated political and religious conflict, sometimes more overt, sometimes relatively dormant, had started as a “big bang.” This “big bang” was epitomized, more than anything else, by Omar’s conquest of Jerusalem and the ensuing dramatic changes in the religious topography of the city.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-5-div1-17"></span>
