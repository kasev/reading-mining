<h1 class="h" id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-titleGroup-60"><span class="title1"><span>III</span></span></h1><p class="parafl">The scholarly oscillation mentioned in Section II, p. 144 above between emphasizing either the Jewish or the Christian roots of Islam (and, of course, the various movements between these two main traditions) stems, I think, from an error of method. It is a mistake to choose between a number of options (postulated to be exclusive of one another) in order to identify the roots of theological ideas in earliest Islam. There is no reason to think that in a religious, cultural, and political milieu as complex as that of the sixth- and seventh-century Near East, Islam would have originated from a single source. Moreover, categories which propose a taxonomy of religious ideas tend to freeze them, suppressing their dynamism, erasing their free circulation and their constant restructuration in new forms.</p>
<p class="para">In a world endowed with a great social and religious complexity, the constant interaction and transformation of ideas and persons is the default option, as it were, and permanent fluidity is the essential rule. This is how one should conceive the interface between religious traditions in the Near East, an interface in which Islam was born. One should insist on the flow of religious ideas between communities. The formation of Islam and its early conquests restructured religious communities in the Near East and permitted the stabilization of both religious ideas and boundaries between communities. Referring to the transmission of ideas between religious communities in the Arabic Middle Ages, Sarah Stroumsa has spoken of a “whirlpool effect,” as it is usually impossible to specify the origin of each specific element.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-33" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-33" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">33</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">All this leads to what I propose to call the “principle of non-exclusivity.” I prefer to speak of communities rather than of sects, as this last term entails deviance vis-à-vis an orthodoxy, the existence of which cannot always be demonstrated.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-34" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-34" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">34</sup></a> Proper method demands that we do not identify a source as the sole origin of Qur’anic terms or formulas, to the exclusion of other possible filiations. At the same time, the “principle of non-exclusivity” is also a principle of indetermination. In a world in which religious ideas circulate freely and transform themselves constantly, it is almost impossible to determine the precise origin of these ideas or the proximate channels through which they reached the Qur’an.</p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_150"></span>Arguments highlighting the similarity between various Jewish-Christian concepts and some Qur’anic passages receive their full value only in a discourse insisting upon the plurality of the sources of earliest Islam. According to a number of Christian traditions, the Prophet had met a heretical monk who taught him certain Christian doctrines (in a perverse way, of course). As early as 1858, Nöldeke had raised the question of Muḥammad’s Christian teachers.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-35" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-35" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">35</sup></a> For him, however, the Arab “priest” Waraka was a Jew rather than a Christian. In later Arabic sources, Waraka is deemed to have been “a bishop from the Naṣārā” who “belonged to the Prophet’s family.” Although <i class="calibre1">naṣārā</i> usually refers to Christians, the term may also indicate the <i class="calibre1">nazoraioi</i>, one of the Jewish-Christian sects according to Patristic heresiologists.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-36" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-36" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">36</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Concluding his analysis of the <i class="calibre1">naṣārā/nazoraioi</i> case, the New Testament scholar Joachim Gnilka notes the striking theological proximity between the Qur’an and Jewish-Christian traditions.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-37" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-37" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">37</sup></a> Like other scholars before him, he calls attention to the similarity between Sūra 19 (<i class="calibre1">sūrat Mariam</i>, which deals with Zechariah and the birth of John the Baptist) and the <i class="calibre1">Protoevangelium of James</i>. One must recognize that Gnilka’s results are slightly disappointing, as he remains unable to explain the ways through which these Jewish-Christian concepts may have reached early seventh-century Ḥijāz.</p>
<p class="para">Following Hans-Joachim Schoeps, Martiniano Pellegrino Roncaglia develops Harnack’s thesis on the Jewish-Christian origins of Islam, in reference to the traditions concerning Waraka. For Roncaglia, as for the great German scholar of early Christianity, Islam represents the transformation on Arabic soil of what he calls “Gnostic Jewish-Christianity.” Roncaglia notes that the Islamic prohibition on wine seems to be “Elchasaite.” To the best of my knowledge, no extant source mentions the prohibition on wine among the Elchasaites, <span id="page_151"></span>although, according to Irenaeus, the Ebionites abstain from wine.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-38" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-38" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">38</sup></a> For Roncaglia, moreover, the Jewish-Christian idea of the true prophet lies at the root of the Islamic conception of prophecy. He also points out the similarity between the Ebionite conception of a diabolical falsification of Scripture and the Islamic concept of <i class="calibre1">taḥrīf</i>, that is, the falsification of their revealed Scripture by Jews and Christians.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-39" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-39" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">39</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">For Roncaglia, then, Ebionites and Elchasaites are identical. Such an identification, however, is not based on the sources, and nothing points to an Elchasaite presence in Ḥijāz. The origin of this identification seems to go back to Renan, for whom the Qur’an’s Sabaeans were Elchasaites and Mandaeans, and to Chwolson, who, in his great monograph on the Sabaeans, had detected some Manichaean elements in Islam.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-40" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-40" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">40</sup></a> The Baptist group within which Mani had grown up, in North Mesopotamia of the early third century, had been called <i class="calibre1">mughtasila</i> (Baptists) by the tenth-century Islamic bibliographer Ibn al-Nadīm. These <i class="calibre1">mughtasila</i> seem to have had many affinities with the Elchasaites as the Christian heresiologists present them. The final proof of the identity between the two groups was made by the publication, in 1975, of the Cologne Mani Codex, an ancient biography of the Prophet of Light, found in a Greek version. This text preserves for us precious details on the Elchasaites as Mani had known them in his childhood and youth.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-41" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-41" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">41</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The discovery of the Cologne Mani Codex has triggered renewed reflection on some remarkable parallels between Manichaeism and Islam. Robert Simon, who studied these parallels, has noted that one might have overstressed Judaism and Christianity as possible sources of Islam and that the Manichaean track has almost not been followed.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-42" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-42" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">42</sup></a> Simon calls attention to both the universal character of these two religions, from the time of their birth, and their shared conception of holy books. The most striking similarity concerns the notion of the “seal of prophecy.” This notion, which is fundamental for the Qur’anic idea of prophecy, can already be found in Manichaeism, as I have argued in <a href="part0015_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6" class="calibre3">Chapter 5</a>. It originates in the Jewish-Christian roots of the Religion <span id="page_152"></span>of Light. As noted by Simon, both Mani and Muhammad perceive their prophetic role as being at once the summit and the conclusion of a long chain of prophets, from Adam to Jesus. The Manichaeans, for whom proselytizing was an essential religious duty, had moved to the north-east of the Arabian Peninsula. Simon also postulates the arrival of the Manichaeans in Mecca, along with the Lakhmids, after the collapse of the kingdom of Ḥimyar following the Abyssinian conquest.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-43" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-43" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">43</sup></a> One should note with Patricia Crone, however, that there is no trace of Manichaeism in the Qur’an itself.</p>
<p class="para">In three important articles, published between 1995 and 2004, François de Blois has made significant contributions to research on the Sabaeans in pre-Islamic Arabia, as well as on the terms <i class="calibre1">naṣrānī</i> (according to him an Arabic translation of <i class="calibre1">nazoraios</i>) and <i class="calibre1">hanīf</i> in the Qur’an, and finally on the comparison between Manichaeism and Islam.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-44" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-44" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">44</sup></a> In the first of these articles, de Blois argues that the religious milieu in which Islam emerged included at least five religions: Arab paganism, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism. Following the Maronite scholar Abraham Ecchellensis in 1660, Ernest Renan and Daniel Chwolson proposed in the nineteenth century, as we saw in Section I, p. 143 above, that the Qur’an’s Sabaeans be identified with the Mandaeans. De Blois notes that there is no trace of a hypothetical Mandaean presence in seventh-century Arabia.</p>
<p class="para">In his article on <i class="calibre1">Naṣrānī</i> and <i class="calibre1">ḥanīf</i>, de Blois first argues that in the Qur’an, <i class="calibre1">naşārā</i> indicates Nazorean Jewish-Christians, rather than Christians. He then discusses the meaning of <i class="calibre1">ḥanīf</i>, a puzzling term of Aramaic origin. The Syriac equivalent is quite negative, as it refers to paganism, in contradistinction to the meaning of the term in the Qur’an, where a <i class="calibre1">ḥanīf</i> is a believer in the true religion of Abraham. According to de Blois, the Qur’anic conception of the <i class="calibre1">ḥanīf</i> reflects a polemic against the Nazoreans, a fact which proves the presence of a Jewish-Christian community in seventh-century Arabia.</p>
<p class="para">In “Elchasai—Manes—Muḥammad: Manichäismus und Islam in religionshistorischem Vergleich,” de Blois first offers a synthesis of the results of his investigations so far. Going further, he seeks to explain the remarkable parallels between those two syncretistic religions, Manichaeism and Islam. For him, these parallels, in particular those associated with the idea of prophecy in the two religions, come from their joint Jewish-Christian background. <span id="page_153"></span>De Blois thus proposes to see in the idea of a “seal of prophecy” a Jewish-Christian idea adopted by Muhammad. He concludes by noting that Jewish-Christians find themselves at the very epicenter of the history of religions in the Near East.</p>
<p class="para">The Pseudo-Clementine Homilies offer a major testimony in our quest for Ebionite central theological conceptions, such as the chain of prophecy through the ages. Inter alia, the Pseudo-Clementine writings (both the Latin <i class="calibre1">Recognitions</i> and the Greek <i class="calibre1">Homilies</i>) develop the idea that some scriptural passages were inserted by Satan and must hence be expurgated from the sacred text.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-45" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-45" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">45</sup></a> This early Jewish-Christian conception, which was picked up by Marcion for some of the gospels, will reappear in the (post-Qur’anic) concept of <i class="calibre1">taḥrīf</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-46" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-46" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">46</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The latest contribution to our present problem which I should like to mention here is the work in progress by Holger Zellentin, who has discovered in some Qur’anic passages striking parallels with a number of patristic texts, in particular with the Pseudo-Clementine <i class="calibre1">Homilies</i> and the <i class="calibre1">Didaskalia</i>, a fourth-century text on ritual and legal precepts, rooted in the <i class="calibre1">Didachē</i> (a Jewish-Christian text from the early second century) as well as on Christology and scriptural hermeneutics. Epiphanius, the bishop of Salamis in Cyprus in the fourth century and one of the major heresiologists, who was born in Eleutheropolis (Beit Guvrin), tells us that the <i class="calibre1">Didaskalia</i> was read by Audians in Palestine. We know precious little about the Audians, quartodeciman sectarians from Mesopotamia who read apocryphal texts retaining anthropomorphic esoteric traditions on God’s body. Henri-Charles Puech, who had been the first to call attention to the Audians, showed that some of their traditions were patently Gnostic. He was unable, however, to identify the probable Jewish origin of their conception of the divine body.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-47" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-47" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">47</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Whatever the case might be, the <i class="calibre1">Didaskalia</i> originates in a milieu close to Jewish-Christians, a fact reflected by both its ethics and its conception of ritual purity. Basing his reflections on this closeness, Zellentin believes that the text of the Qur’an “responds” to a specific group of Jewish-Christians in its audience. More precisely, the Qur’an stands, for him, between Jewish-Christians and rabbinic Jews in its legal culture as well as in its approach to ritual practices. <span id="page_154"></span>Although Zellentin still has to publish much of his recent research, what we already know of it suggests that it will open new horizons and a broadened discussion of Qur’anic origins.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-48" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-48" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">48</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">One of the most striking parallels between the Pseudo-Clementine writings and the Qur’an is probably Peter’s claim, in the <i class="calibre1">Homilies</i>, that “God is one, and there is no God but Him.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-49" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-49" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">49</sup></a> Although this partial presence of the Qur’anic <i class="calibre1">shahāda</i> in an early Jewish-Christian text has already been noticed, it does not seem to have received all the attention it deserves. Other similarities are worth noting, although they do not constitute conclusive evidence, such as for instance the Qur’anic term “believers” (<i class="calibre1">mu’minūn</i>). The same word (<i class="calibre1">pisteuontes</i> in Greek), indeed, refers in the New Testament (Acts) to Jews who have recognized Jesus as the Messiah without giving up on the practice of the biblical commandments in their traditional Jewish interpretation. In patristic literature, from Origen to the testimony of Arculf, a Gaulish monk who came to the Holy Land on a pilgrimage in the 680s, <i class="calibre1">pisteuontes</i> (or its Latin equivalent, <i class="calibre1">credentes</i>) often refers to Jewish-Christians. Arculf, as quoted by Adomnan, mentions the existence in Jerusalem of a community of “believing” Jews, side by side with that of Jews who refuse to recognize Jesus as the Messiah announced by the prophets.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-50" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-50" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">50</sup></a> Shlomo Pines has proposed seeing in the Qur’anic concept <i class="calibre1">mu’min</i>, plur. <i class="calibre1">mu’minūn</i> (for instance Qur’an 2:62; 5:69; 22:17), a linguistic calque of the term <i class="calibre1">pisteuōn</i> (or <i class="calibre1">credens</i>). According to him, “believers” would thus refer in the Qur’an to Jewish-Christians, side by side with Jews, Christians (<i class="calibre1">naşārā</i>), Sabaeans, and Zoroastrians (<i class="calibre1">majūs</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-51" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-51" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">51</sup></a> One should also note that the Qur’anic <i class="calibre1">mushrikūn</i> (from <i class="calibre1">shirk</i>, association), traditionally perceived as polytheists, are considered by Gerald Hawting and Patricia Crone to have been monotheists.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-52" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-52" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">52</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In a series of articles, published from 1966 to 1987, Pines offered a very powerful argument for the survival of some Jewish-Christian communities until at least early Islam.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-53" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-53" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">53</sup></a> Sadly, Pines’s articles have not had the impact one <span id="page_155"></span>might have imagined. This is due both to the technical nature of his arguments and to the fact that these publications are not always easy to find. Moreover, the conservative instinct of the scholarly community, to some extent still prisoner of the patristic tradition, has proven unwilling to admit the survival of Jewish-Christian groups after the fourth century.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-54" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-54" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">54</sup></a> Pines establishes his arguments, first, upon the discovery of new anti-Christian polemical texts in Arabic (and Judeo-Arabic) and in Hebrew.
