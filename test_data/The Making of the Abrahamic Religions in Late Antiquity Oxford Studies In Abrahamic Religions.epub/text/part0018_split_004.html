<p class="parafl">As we search for proximate channels of transmission of late antique conceptions to early Islam, we should draw particular attention to the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire. In this context, Philip Wood focuses on the “emergence of cultural independence in a region where Syriac, a barbarian language, achieved significance.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-19" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a> Wood adds that Myaphysite political thought displaces attributes of the emperor, as the guardian of Christianity and the preserver of orthodoxy, onto local holy men and non-Christian rulers. This explains, at least partly, how conceptions originally attached to the emperor could have been transferred in the pre-Islamic Near East to less distant, less abstract and alienated figures, closer to the local populations. Syriac Myaphysite conceptions could then more easily have an impact upon Muhammad’s milieu.</p>
<p class="para">We must now reflect upon the Christian discourse on theocracy in order to understand better the context in which the early Islamic attitude to religious and political authority was born. Indeed, the theocratic argument as developed by Eusebius, which then became the fundamental principle of Byzantine political thought, conceived God as “the great king” (<i class="calibre1">Tricennalia</i> I. 3; I. 5) celebrated by the whole cosmos. According to Eusebius, Constantine, the Christian emperor, represented the earthly image, or <i class="calibre1">eikōn</i> of God.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-20" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> For him, the first Christian monarch becomes a new David, as the history of the church is for him a continuation of the biblical <i class="calibre1">historia sacra</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-21" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> In <i class="calibre1">Empereur et prêtre</i>, Gilbert Dagron has rightly insisted upon the fact that too much importance has been given in the past to the sacrality of Hellenistic kings and to the Roman concept of <i class="calibre1">pontifex maximus</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-22" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> For Dagron, the main source of Byzantine political thought is the Old Testament. This dramatic importance of the Hebrew Bible, much more marked than in the West, is also explained for him by the much stronger presence of Jewish communities in the Eastern Empire.</p>
<p class="para">
<span id="page_131"></span>The traditional perception of the difference between the Byzantine and the Western medieval models of theological and political powers was long ago synthesized by Ernst Kantorowitz.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-23" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a> According to this rather simplistic categorization, the Western model distinguished between “the two powers,” that of the church and that of the state, as autonomous from one another, while in the East, there was a confusion between them.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-24" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> <i class="calibre1">Cesaropapism</i> is a term invented by the German legal scholar Heinrich Boehmer (1674–1749) and often utilized, since the second half of the nineteenth century, in order to describe, in pejorative fashion, the Byzantine system.</p>
<p class="para">Justinian’s words when entering for the first time the newly completed church of Hagia Sophia, “I have surpassed thee, O Solomon,” might well be apocryphal. It does not really matter. What counts, again, is the perception of the Byzantine emperor as an Old Testament figure. A new David and a new Solomon, the emperor is also modeled upon the first leader of the Hebrews: Moses.</p>
<p class="para">Philo describes Moses as a <i class="calibre1">nomos empsychos</i>, an animated <i class="calibre1">nomos</i>, using a term usually reserved for Hellenistic kings. Clement takes over from Philo his description of Moses. For him, however, it is the only-begotten Son, the incarnated Logos, who is the best and true lawgiver, the perfect man, even higher than Moses.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-25" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a> The political theory of Philo, representing the Jewish version of Hellenistic political thought, thus becomes the basis of a Christian political philosophy. The Hebrew polity instituted by Moses becomes the model for a perfect society, far better than the other societies of the <i class="calibre1">oikoumenē</i>: “Moses furnished a good polity, which is the right discipline of men in social life.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-26" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a> Yet, the Christian thinker does not forget that Moses is but a figure of Christ, who alone represents perfection. Hence, if the Greek polity is brass, the Jewish polity is silver, and the Christian polity is gold.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-27" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-27" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">27</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Here as elsewhere, Clement of Alexandria, toward the end of the second century, was deeply influenced by Philo. Like other Christian thinkers, Clement <span id="page_132"></span>was convinced that Moses’ preeminence over Greek and other pagan national and religious leaders was based upon his antecedence: the Jewish leader came first, just as the Hebrew language is older than Greek. A highly complex theory about the history of religions and cultures follows from Clement’s conception. Clement appears, thus, also as a quite interesting, even original, historian of religions and cultures. I have dealt elsewhere with his conception of cultural memory, within which one must understand his perception of national and religious leaders of the past.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-28" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">To be sure, Clement’s view of Moses is based upon that of Philo, Yet, Clement had specific reasons of his own for seeing Moses as the perfect lawgiver. Clement was a contemporary of Celsus, a Platonic philosopher who is known to us through his anti-Christian tractate <i class="calibre1">Alēthēs Logos</i>—or, more precisely, through what remains of it in Origen’s quotations in his <i class="calibre1">Contra Celsum,</i> written some seventy years later. Celsus had accused Christians of having given up the “ancestral laws” (<i class="calibre1">patrioi nomoi</i>) of the Jews, while claiming to retain their holy books. In a sense, then, Clement’s description of Moses as the perfect <i class="calibre1">nomothetēs</i> reflects the polemics about the legitimacy of Christianity around the middle of the second century. In order to be accepted as a recognized religion (<i class="calibre1">religio licita</i>), it needed to show itself to be established upon an ancestral religious law. As Christian thinkers in general, and Platonists in particular, insisted on their allegorical reading of the Hebrew scriptures, which were supposed to be their religious law, Celsus could present a strong case against Christianity. It is in this context that one should see Clement’s perception of Moses as both a religious and a political leader: he needs to defend Christianity from an overall allegorical reading of biblical history. In an article on Clement’s view of the past, Raoul Mortley pointed out a noticeable lack of scholarly interest in Clement’s ideas on history—and hence on Moses as a lawgiver and political leader.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-29" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a> For Mortley, this stemmed from the discrepancy between these views and the overall spirit of Clement’s Platonic thought. It is precisely this discrepancy, correctly detected by Mortley, which highlights <span id="page_133"></span>the significance of Clement’s argument about Moses. Clement’s perception of Moses is thus parallel to his view of Numa. Both are at once religious and political leaders: in the ancient world, religion has an inherent public dimension, and is then, essentially, <i class="calibre1">civil</i> religion.</p>
