<p class="parafl">Both the legal and social situation of the Jews seriously deteriorated from the end of the fourth century. As intercommunal violence between Jews and Christians became more and more common, the authorities hesitated between legal protection of the Jews and passive or even active support of the Christian mobs, which often moved with the blessing of the bishops. In a famous (or rather, infamous) letter to Theodosius I, written in 388, Bishop Ambrose of Milan opposes the emperor’s decision to punish those responsible for burning down a synagogue in Callinicum, a town on the Euphrates. To strengthen his case, Ambrose lists cities where Jews had burned churches: Gaza, Ascalon, Beirut, Alexandria. The outcome of the Callinicum affair seems to have brought the emperors to reaffirm in legal documents the right of Jews to meet unhindered in their synagogues, as did, for instance, Theodosius himself in 393.</p>
<p class="para">Two examples of ecclesiastical policy discouraging social interaction between Jews and Christians may be mentioned. The Council of Elvira, held in early fourth-century Spain, had forbidden intermarriage between Christians and Jews. The Council of Vannes, in Gaul, meeting between 461 and 491, stated that it was “shameful and sacrilegious for Christians to eat [Jews’] food.” In doing so, the Council was applying against Jews in reverse, as it were, the strong Jewish limitations on social contact with Christians.</p>
<p class="para">A particularly striking document on the wave of violence against Jews, up to forced conversion, is the remarkable letter written by Severus, the bishop of Minorca. In his <i class="calibre1">Letter Concerning the Jews</i>, Severus recounts how the Jewish community on the island was converted to Christianity in 418. A polemic between Christians and Jews soon turns into a street battle, ending in the burning of the synagogue. Severus notes, however, that the Christian arsonists took great care to save the holy books from the fire. He concludes his account by reporting that in the days following the burning of their synagogue, 540 Jews converted to Christianity out of fear for their lives, eventually building a church on the ruins of the synagogue. Even if this text cannot be taken at face value in all its details, it remains emblematic of the new state of affairs and reflects the deep worsening of the Jews’ status. From the same year, an <span id="page_112"></span>imperial edict forbids Jews (“those living according to the Jewish superstition”) to join the armed forces. The same edict, however, reaffirms their right to be legal advocates and town councilors.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-28"></span>
