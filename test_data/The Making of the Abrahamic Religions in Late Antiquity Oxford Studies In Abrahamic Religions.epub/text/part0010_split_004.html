<p class="parafl">We have seen so far how some deep psychological and cultural transformations in the Roman world both permitted and imposed a radical restructuring of the very idea of ritual. The rise of Scriptures as the very backbone of religious movements transformed attitudes toward religious stories, or myths. It stands to reason that a similar transformation of the ritual should be discerned, as all religions hinge upon the two functions of myth-making (or telling) and ritual action. To a new conception of <i class="calibre1">historia sacra</i> should correspond a new kind of religious praxis.</p>
<p class="para">I suggested above that the traditional distinction of polytheistic versus monotheistic religions is not always particularly useful from a heuristic <span id="page_35"></span>viewpoint. Indeed, in the ancient world, both polytheists and monotheists used to offer blood sacrifices to the divinity or divinities, and considered such sacrifices to represent the very acme of religious life. Thus, Emperor Julian, in the second half of the fourth century, could write that “the Jews behave like the Gentiles, except the fact that they recognize only one god. In everything else, however, we share the same things: temples, sanctuaries, altars, purification rituals, various demands in which we do not diverge from one another, or else only in insignificant ways.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-19" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">
<i class="calibre1">Sacrificiorum aboleatur insania</i>. (Let the madness of sacrifices end!) This law of Constantinus II, preserved in the Theodosian Codex, encapsulates the revolution started by Constantine and pursued by his successors.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-20" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> This revolution was radical in its consequences: it brought an end to public sacrifices. To be sure, the idea of animal (or for that matter human) sacrifice never quite disappeared, and various traces of it are retained in later forms of Christianity, while Islam has a feast of sacrifice (<i class="calibre1">’Eid al-aḍḥa</i>).</p>
<p class="para">Long before the fourth century <span class="sc">ce</span>, a major debate had been raging in Hellenic thought on the value of sacrifice. Lucian of Samosata, that second-century Voltaire, who knew how to poke fun at various ritual practices and religious attitudes, had sharply criticized sacrifices in his diatribe <i class="calibre1">Peri thusiōn</i> (“On sacrifices”). In the third century, Porphyry, following Theophrastus and his <i class="calibre1">Peri eusebeias</i> (“On piety”), could claim that the philosopher was the true priest of the supreme god, and that his thought was the true temple. It is this identity that isolates the philosopher from the <i class="calibre1">polis</i> and its public rituals. In his treatise <i class="calibre1">De abstinentia</i>, Porphyry, drawing the logical consequence of his repulsion from animal killing, argues in favor of vegetarianism. In this context, one should call attention to his belief that the Jews are a race of philosophers, precisely because their sacrificial practices, in contradistinction to those of other peoples, are due to historical necessities rather than to low instincts. For Porphyry, then, true sacrifice is union with god, accomplished by the wise man through <i class="calibre1">apatheia</i> (lack of passions).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-21" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Even a traditionalist like Iamblichus, who argues in favor of sacrifices, recognizes that they are not needed by the superior beings. Blood sacrifices, for him, are expected only by the lower gods, and represent only the material aspect of cult. For him, thus, spiritual sacrifices exist side by side with blood sacrifices.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-22" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">When their single temple, in Jerusalem, was destroyed by Titus in 70 <span class="sc">ce</span>, the Jews had to reinvent their religion in some dramatic ways, while arguing that <span id="page_36"></span>they were changing very little, and this only under duress. If Jews could be perceived by some as a race of philosophers (for instance by Numenius, who argued in the second century <span class="sc">ce</span>, that Plato was “an atticizing Moses”), it seems to me that it is in no small measure due to the fact that they could now be perceived as a religion without blood sacrifices. Some dramatic consequences followed from the destruction of the Temple. The first was the birth of two new religions, rather than one. Side by side with the birth of Christianity, the appearance of rabbinic Judaism after 70 <span class="sc">ce</span> and its growth in the following centuries represent a real mutation of the religion of Israel. Indeed, it had now become a religion with no sacrifices, whose priests were out of business, in which religious specialists had been replaced by the intellectual elite. In a way, early Christianity, a religion centered upon a sacrificial ritual celebrated by priests, represents a more obvious continuity with the religion of Israel than that of the rabbis. The Temple’s fall, and the impossibility of offering sacrifices, entailed the transformation of the ritual: daily sacrifices were now replaced by prayers recalling the sacrifices of old. The absence of a temple and the neutralization of priests, in turn, brought at once a spatial explosion of Jewish ritual and its democratization. There was no <i class="calibre1">omphalos</i> anymore, no obvious place that God could call His own house.</p>
<p class="para">According to a famous rabbinic conception, the <i class="calibre1">shekhina</i>, or divine presence (from the root <i class="calibre1">shakhan</i>, to dwell), exiled from the destroyed Temple, was now staying within “the four cubits of <i class="calibre1">halakha</i>,” within the small limits of personal religious duties.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-23" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a> In other words, religion had now moved from the public to the private sphere. <i class="calibre1">Askēsis</i>, prayer, almsgiving: the various duties of private religion were all considered as due replacements for sacrifice. A rabbinic text compares, for instance, the fat burnt during a fast to the fat of a sacrificial animal.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-24" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> When the rabbis say that after the destruction of the Temple, an iron wall rose between God and Israel, they mean to insist on the fact that Judaism has become a religion of alienation, a religion of God’s absence.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-25" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a> Man must behave as if he did not expect a clear and distinct voice to answer his prayers, as if the time-consecrated <i class="calibre1">do ut des</i> formula did not work anymore. In a way, this attitude is rather similar to that of the church fathers, about whom one could speak, in Weberian parlance, of an <i class="calibre1">Entzauberung</i> (“disenchantment”). The religion of the rabbis had replaced that of the prophets. The priests had disappeared for all practical purposes. They might have been a catalyst for the development of new mystical attitudes within the Jewish community. It stands to reason that the forms of mystical experience, as they are described in late antique Hebrew literature, and also in Gnostic and Judeo-Christian texts and traditions, were somewhat similar to those <span id="page_37"></span>encountered by the priests in the Temple, who were likely to have had a deep sense of the presence of the divine.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-26" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In strong opposition to rabbinic Judaism, emerging from the Council of Yavne after the destruction of the Temple, early Christianity unabashedly presented itself as a sacrificial religion, although one of a new kind, in which the central ritual was called <i class="calibre1">anamnēsis</i>, a reactualization, or even reactivation—rather than our weaker term “memory”—of Jesus’ sacrifice. It was a religion without temples, in which the same sacrifice was offered perpetually, on a daily basis. It was offered by priests, organized in a hierarchy (in contradistinction to the basic equality of rank between rabbis). The very metaphorizing of biblical traditions by Christian thinkers permitted the conservation of the terms of Israelite religion. One also finds in early Christian literature, as in rabbinic texts, a metaphorical use of sacrifice: Clement of Rome, already, refers to “a contrite heart” as the true sacrifice, whereas the fourth-century Euchites, or Messalians, will develop, as in Qumran, a theory and practice of continual prayer in order to keep Satan away in terms alluding to the “perpetual sacrifice” in the Jerusalem Temple.</p>
<p class="para">In Christian literature of the first centuries one can follow the clear development of sacrificial vocabulary. The language of martyrdom, strikingly, is replete with allusions to sacrifice. The clearest testimony of this perception of martyrdom as a sacrifice is probably the <i class="calibre1">Martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicity</i>. <i class="calibre1">Imitatio Christi</i>, when it goes as far as the willingness to give one’s life for one’s faith, transforms the martyr, like Jesus, into a sacrifice, more precisely, a human sacrifice. This is very significant, as human sacrifices were considered by pagans and Christians alike in the Roman Empire as representing the very border between humanity and barbarism.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-27" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-27" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">27</sup></a> As the historian of art Jas Elsner has been able to show, the transformation of Roman art from Augustus to Justinian reflects a deep evolution of subjectivity in Roman culture. The martyrs do not offer sacrifice; they are the sacrifice, and no reciprocity, no immediate <i class="calibre1">quid pro quo</i> is expected from the divinity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-28" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a> In that sense, Christian martyrdom reflects a radical change in the conception of sacrifice, a fundamental break in the very nature of religion.</p>
<p class="para">More than the rabbis, the church fathers were quite aware of the novelty of their religion and of the originality of their thought. This awareness is reflected, for instance, in their ability to offer what one can call “histories of religion,” and theses about the evolution of religious doctrines and practices, in particular, sacrifice, from the earliest times. Similar conceptions are much rarer among Jewish thinkers, and only Maimonides, in the twelfth century, would <span id="page_38"></span>develop a full-fledged historical and comparative theory of sacrifice, a theory which retains traces of a Christian influence.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-29" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">To conclude these brief reflections on the transformation of the ritual, one should perhaps point out once more the deep ambiguity of sacrifice. Transformed, reinterpreted, metaphorized, memorized, it seems never to die out quite completely. Late antiquity experienced the end of public sacrifices as the core of religious praxis, but that did not mean an end to the very idea of sacrifice.</p>
