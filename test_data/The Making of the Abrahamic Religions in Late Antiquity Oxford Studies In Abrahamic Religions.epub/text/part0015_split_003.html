<span class="title1"><span>III</span></span></h1>
<p class="parafl">Among other aspects of his complex religious self-identity, Mani considered himself to be the Paraclete of the <i class="calibre1">Endzeit</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-20" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> In his very peculiar, but nonetheless very intensely lived, <i class="calibre1">imitatio Jesu</i>, Mani considered his rejection of <span id="page_92"></span>Elchasaite ritual to be parallel to the way in which Jesus had argued with the Pharisees about various points of the Law. In particular, Mani rejected the baptism of the Elchasaites and their frequent ablutions, which, he argued, had no soteriological value whatsoever.</p>
<p class="para">“From Baptism to Gnosis,” the apt title of Ludwig Koenen’s systematic study,<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-21" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> emphasizes the basic shift accomplished by Mani and his followers in their approach to ritual. If the Manichaeans, however, rejected baptism, they did not reject all kinds of cult. It would seem, in particular, that they maintained a certain initiatory cult, which they called <i class="calibre1">seal</i>; the scant, but nonetheless conclusive evidence has been analyzed by Henri-Charles Puech.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-22" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> To his conclusions, one should add that this Manichaean <i class="calibre1">seal</i> might well have evolved from the Elchasaite baptism.</p>
<p class="para">Thus, we read in the Manichaean <i class="calibre1">Psalter</i>, found in a Coptic version which preserves some of the earliest strata of Manichaean literature:</p>
<div class="displaytexta">
<div class="linegroup">
<p class="parafl">Receive the holy Seal (<i class="calibre1">sphragis</i>) from</p>
<p class="parafl">the Mind of the Church,</p>
<p class="parafl">and fulfill the commandments (<i class="calibre1">Ps</i>. 22: 11–12)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="parafl">Despite this probable original and primary meaning, however, the Manichaean metaphor cannot remain, any more than any other metaphor, univalent. Indeed, we know of various meanings of the word in early Manichaean texts and traditions. In the <i class="calibre1">Psalter</i>, again, Jesus is addressed thus:</p>
<div class="displaytexta">
<div class="seriesinfo">
<p class="line1">Thou also art the seal (<i class="calibre1">sphragis</i>) of every wonder (60: 3–4)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="parafl">Elsewhere in the same work we read:</p>
<div class="displaytexta">
<div class="linegroup">
<p class="parafl">Receive the seal of the <i class="calibre1">stauros</i>—call—</p>
<p class="parafl">Receive not the seal outwardly (189: 13–15)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="parafl">In the <i class="calibre1">Kephalaia</i>, similarly, the catechumen is sealed in his soul with the “Seal of Faith and the Seal of Truth” (or of gnosis; 225: 11–20). We read elsewhere in the same work that the <i class="calibre1">Spiritus Vivens</i> has fastened all his members (i.e. the Manichaeans) with a Chain of Peace, and sealed them with the Seal of Truth (143: 25–30). It is difficult to establish whether in these examples <i class="calibre1">seal</i> refers to a precise <i class="calibre1">Sitz im Leben</i>, or whether the metaphor does not imply any specific <span id="page_93"></span>reference. Sometime before his Passion, Mani wrote to all his churches a “Letter of the Seal” (<i class="calibre1">frwrdg-ī-mwhr)</i>, which might be identical to his testament (<i class="calibre1">diathēkē</i>). The corrupt passage, however, mentioning this letter leaves no indication as to the meaning of <i class="calibre1">seal</i> in this case.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-23" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Yet another precise conception, that of the “three seals” (<i class="calibre1">Ps</i>. 94: 12), appears time and again in the <i class="calibre1">Psalter</i><a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-24" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a>:</p>

<p class="parafl">or else:</p>

</div>
<p class="parafl">The best description of what these <i class="calibre1">three seals</i> stood for in Manichaean theology is provided by Augustine. In his anti-Manichaean polemical works, the bishop of Hippo often refers to the three <i class="calibre1">signacula</i>, which stand for the main aspects of the ethics of his former coreligionists, whom he now calls “those false and lying saints” (<i class="calibre1">Conf</i>. V. 10).</p>
<p class="para">The <i class="calibre1">signaculum oris</i>, the seal of the mouth, refers to their ritual diet (i.e., their vegetarianism and other food prohibitions) as well as to the prohibition on lies and evil words. The <i class="calibre1">signaculum manuum</i>, the seal of the hands, stands for the prohibition on murder, which does not only extend to men and animals, but also to the vegetal world, which Mani considered to be souled. The <i class="calibre1">signaculum sinus</i>, finally—the seal of the bosom—symbolizes the encratism of the Manichaean elect, their prohibition on marriage and sexual relations.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-25" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a> In these three cases, the <i class="calibre1">seal</i> would seem to be something which <i class="calibre1">shuts up</i> the part of the body to which it is applied, thus preventing sin through the mouth, the hands, or the bosom.</p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_94"></span>These three famous “moral” seals, however, are not the only consecrated symbols of the Manichaean faith. As the Iranist Abraham V. W. Jackson showed long ago, they should be seen in parallel with four other seals, known from the Turfan texts, and of a more doctrinal character.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-26" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a> These are the “four light seals,” as they are called in the X<sup class="calibre4">u</sup>āstvānīft, a manual for the confession of sins extant only in an Uighur translation.

<p class="para">The relevant passage reads thus:</p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">In Äzrua, tängri, in the God of the Sun and Moon, in the powerful God and the prophets have we put our trust, we have relied on them (and) have become Auditors. Four Light Seals have we sealed in our hearts. Firstly Love, the seal of Äzrua, tängri, secondly Faith, the seal of the God of the Sun and Moon, thirdly the Fear (of God), the seal of the Fivefold God, (and) fourthly Wisdom, the seal of the prophets (<i class="calibre1">burxan</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-28" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre5">28</sup></a></p>
<p class="quote">(VIII.13)</p>
</div>
<p class="parafl">Those four light seals represent the four cardinal aspects of Manichaean theology, alluded to elsewhere in the doctrine of “the Fourfold God” (<i class="calibre1">ton tetraprosōpon patera tou megethous</i>), as he is called in the longer Greek formula of abjuration.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-29" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_95"></span>The <i class="calibre1">Fihrist</i> of Ibn al-Nadīm preserves another, slightly different, version of these four articles of faith, which were part of Mani’s <i class="calibre1">Law</i>, speaking of “faith in the four greatnesses, namely (1) God, (2) His Light, (3) His Power, (4) His Wisdom.” The text adds: “His wisdom is the Holy Religion”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-30" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a> (composed of teachers, deacons, priests, the Elect, and the Hearers). It would thus seem that the “seal of the prophets” of the <i class="calibre1">X<sup class="calibre4">u</sup>āstvānīft</i> must be connected with “the Holy Religion” of the <i class="calibre1">Fihrist</i>, i.e. the Manichaean Church.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-31" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-31" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">31</sup></a> This hypothesis is corroborated by another passage in the <i class="calibre1">X<sup class="calibre4">u</sup>āstvānīft</i>:</p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">If we should somehow, unwittingly, have sinned against the holy Electi, who do meritorious deeds, and bring redemption, and if we, although we called (them) “true messenger of God” and “prophet”, (still) should not have believed (this): “The holy Elect is characterized by good deeds.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-32" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-32" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre5">32</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="parafl">In other words the <i class="calibre1">electi</i> are explicitly called prophets (<i class="calibre1">burxan</i>), or “true messengers of God.” Thus, the metaphorical expression “seal of the prophets” is indeed found in a Manichaean text and might well be of pre-Islamic origin. But the prophets referred to in this phrase are in no way Mani’s predecessors, but rather his followers. Moreover, the <i class="calibre1">seal</i> metaphor does not imply either in this expression or in any of the other pre-Islamic mentions of the term studied here, a reference to “last,” but, rather, relates to the idea of confirmation, or attestation.</p>
