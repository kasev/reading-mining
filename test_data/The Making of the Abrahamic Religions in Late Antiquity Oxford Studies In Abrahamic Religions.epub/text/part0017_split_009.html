<p class="parafl">For both Christians and Jews, the political borders of the Roman Empire were far from coinciding with linguistic boundaries. The Jews of North Africa, Italy, Gaul, or Spain, who left so few written traces of their thought or literary creativity, spoke Latin. In the great cities of the eastern part of the Empire, for instance in Asia Minor, Jews spoke Greek. In the Near East, however, <span id="page_116"></span>including in Palestine, they usually spoke Aramaic, like the native Christians, who cultivated their own version of Aramaic, Syriac. In that sense, the special case of Palestine may be misleading, since there the Christian elites often spoke Greek. The Jewish elites understood Greek, as Origen’s dealings with the rabbis in Caesarea Maritima show (these were obviously carried on in Greek). And yet, Greek was not the rabbis’ language of written expression. In the Syrian Orient, however, Jews and Christians shared more or less the same language, Aramaic, which had been the <i class="calibre1">lingua franca</i> of the area for a long time. This was the case on both sides of the political border between the Romans and the Sasanians.</p>
<p class="para">The essential difference in the linguistic scene between Jews and Christians is, of course, a matter of weight. It is in Greek, and sometimes in Latin, that the leading Christian thinkers expressed their theologies. Other Christian literatures—Syriac in particular, but also Coptic and Armenian—are very rich; yet they remain marginal to the centers of political power in the Empire. For the Jews of the East, in contradistinction, literary creativity took place in Aramaic and Hebrew. There are no literary remains whatsoever of the powerful Jewish communities who spoke either Greek or Latin. The striking disappearance of Hellenistic Jewish literary culture, already noted by Joseph Justus Scaliger, remains to this day a historical puzzle. On the face of it, the Jewish communities in the Byzantine Empire would appear to be the direct heirs of Hellenistic Judaism.</p>
<p class="para">This sharing of a language is clearly meaningful for the Jewish and Christian Northern Syrian and Mesopotamian communities (in both cases minorities that were sometimes persecuted), where geographical proximity adds to the probability that some degree of mutual cultural influence and interdependence of literary works remains. Scholars have long searched Syriac literature for evidence of rabbinic influences. In the fourth century, one of the early major Syriac authors, Aphrahat, known as “the Persian sage,” retains in his <i class="calibre1">Demonstrations</i> various traces of rabbinic exegetical traditions.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-25" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a></p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-32"></span>
