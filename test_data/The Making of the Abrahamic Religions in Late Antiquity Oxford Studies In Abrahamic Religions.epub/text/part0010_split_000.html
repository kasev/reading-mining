<p class="parafl">For the historian of religions, the end of animal sacrifices as the centerpiece of public religion is certainly one of the most important problems at the end of the ancient world. Indeed, early Christian attitudes to animal sacrifices have attracted considerable scholarly attention of late, in a number of books. The main problem with most of these works, however, is their almost exclusive focus upon Christianity, while ignoring rabbinic Judaism, a religion born concomitantly with Christianity, and from the very same roots, the Second Temple version of the religion of biblical Israel. From a methodological perspective, such an approach is seriously mistaken, as what obtains in Judaism may give us some important clues as to the more general trend in late antique religion. The profound transformations of religion in late antiquity, throughout the Mediterranean and the Near East, have brought some scholars to propose seeing in late antiquity a new “axial age”—using the concept popularized by the German philosopher Karl Jaspers.</p>
