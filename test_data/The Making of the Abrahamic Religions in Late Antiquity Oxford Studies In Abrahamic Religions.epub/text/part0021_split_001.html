<p class="parafl">From the perspective of the historian of comparative religion, the real peculiarity of the Temple Mount lies in its resilience and versatility. In striking contrast to the Delphic <i class="calibre1">omphalos</i>—the navel of the earth—this <i class="calibre1">axis mundi</i> has, throughout history, symbolized more a border between clashing civilizations than the epicenter of a culture. There are other places that are sacred to more than one religious tradition.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-1" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> But no other place on earth, to my knowledge, has retained to such a degree, over centuries, its deeply attractive power as the <span id="page_160"></span>venue for a series of cultures transforming themselves and replacing one another.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-2" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">If religious history, to a great extent, is the history of the devaluations and revalorizations of various manifestations of the sacred, then the Temple Mount can be said to model a significant portion of it. Over the last two thousand years, at least, the Temple Mount has constituted a unique pole of attraction for competing myths and rituals, both successive and juxtaposed. Moreover, the transmission of sacral power from one tradition to another has always been compounded by the interaction between those traditions and the dialectics of their own transformation.</p>
<p class="para">As far as we know, the Temple Mount first owed its sacredness to Solomon’s construction of his Temple there. In other words, its holiness was acquired rather than native. What is perhaps most striking is the retention of its sacred character for Jews even after repeated destructions. Rather than losing its sacred character, it seems to have become, more than ever before, the locus of God’s Presence, or <i class="calibre1">shekhinah</i> (from the root <i class="calibre1">sh.k.n</i>., dwell)—a concept that developed in rabbinic literature only after Titus’s destruction of the Temple. As long as the Temple stood, there was no need to emphasize that it was the dwelling place of the divinity. In a sense, the emptiness of the Temple Mount during the Byzantine period reflected the aniconic nature of God in the former Temple. Indeed, to the puzzlement of pagans, the Temple of the Jews contained no statue of their God, not even in the Holy of Holies. Pagans could thus easily consider the Temple to be empty. Incidentally, the Temple’s emptiness is echoed, as it were, in the Cenotaph of the church of the Anastasis and in the empty space of a mosque, in particular that of the <i class="calibre1">miḥrāb</i>, the niche indicating the <i class="calibre1">qibla</i>, Mecca’s direction.</p>
<p class="para">From the destruction of the Second Temple, however, the Jews were no longer the only community concerned with the Temple Mount. Between the fourth and the seventh centuries, Christian leaders sought to erase the memory of the Temple (in contradistinction to the splendor of the Basilica of the Anastasis)—to accomplish, in a sense, what the Romans called the damnation of memory (<i class="calibre1">damnatio memoriae</i>) of the barren Mount. But, for the Jews, <span id="page_161"></span>despite its barrenness, the Mount became the place that most powerfully recorded the glory that was once Jerusalem.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-3" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a> It became what French historians call a “place of memory” (<i class="calibre1">lieu de mémoire)</i>, or rather, a memory of the place (<i class="calibre1">mémoire du lieu)</i>. Notwithstanding the report of Dio Cassius (69.12), the Hadrianic Capitolium or temple of Zeus, which stood until the fourth century, was not built on the Temple Mount. Though there may have been some imperial statues, the holy place, in the main, stood desolate and empty, pointing—for Jews—to a future rebuilding. In the Christian mind, too, the Temple would play a part in the future, but only in the eschatological future, when the Antichrist would establish his throne there.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-4" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> The eschatological dimension of Christian thought, however, paled with time, particularly after Constantine—or so it seemed. For Jews, on the other hand, the reconstruction of the Temple was not only conceivable in theory—and, of course, prayed for three times daily—but was also considered achievable in practice, as showed by the events surrounding the Emperor Julian’s authorization of its reconstruction in 361.</p>
<p class="para">As highlighted by both Christian and Jewish attitudes to the future of the Temple Mount, there can be no sacred place without a sacred time. While the Temple was standing, sacred times were those of sacrifices, of holy days. After its destruction, the sacred time, the temporal axis around which history was developing, became the eschatological time of its reconstruction. The barren Temple Mount, then, points to a time as well as to the building that once stood there. Or, rather, it points to two opposite moments in time, past and future—when the Temple stood, and when it will stand again—and to Israel and humankind at the beginning and end of history, the <i class="calibre1">Urzeit</i> and the <i class="calibre1">Endzeit</i>. In a sense, one can say that the sacredness of time is a projection of the sacredness of space. Between Christians and Jews, then, the Temple Mount stood at the core of a dialectic: the one’s loss was the other’s gain. For Jews, the reconstruction of Temple would herald the advent of the Messiah, while for Christians it would announce that of the Antichrist.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-5" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> Hence, the <span id="page_162"></span>Temple Mount played (and plays) a role in clashing visions of the end, at the core of the competition between the two religions.</p>
<p class="para">Various clashes between civilizations, focusing on the Jerusalem Temple, had occurred in the past: the Babylonians, from the East, and the Romans, from the West, had each in turn destroyed it for its reflection of a vanquished people’s identity. Later, the invaders of the seventh century <span class="sc">ce</span>, for a brief but violent time the Persians and then the Arabs, would bring back with a vengeance the eschatological expectations of earlier times, which the Christians had thought banished to the back of their consciousness.</p>
<p class="para">Two highly different vignettes, both from Christian sources, symbolize the Christian reaction to the victorious entry of Caliph Omar into Jerusalem. The first portrays him, still dusty from the journey, dismounting from his horse to be invited by Patriarch Sophronius to pray in the Church of the Anastasis (Holy Sepulchre). Omar allegedly replied politely but firmly in the negative. Had he accepted, he added, Muslims would have transformed the church into a mosque after his death. In the second vignette, Sophronius laments seeing Omar on the Temple Mount; for him, indeed, it is nothing less than the repudiation of the desolation announced by Christ.</p>
<p class="para">By transforming the so-called Mosque of Omar into a church, dedicated as the Templum Solomonis, the Crusaders, at least for a while, changed the parameters of the opposition between the Mount and the Anastasis. In 1099 they could exclaim, “Ad Dominicum sepulcrum, dehinc etiam ad Templum!” (“Up to the tomb of the Lord, hence, up to the Temple!”). The Crusaders, indeed, are a reminder of the Christians’ ultimate inability to settle for a spiritual temple or forget the old one of stone.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-6" href="part0021_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-10-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> But this inability could only be due to the dominating presence of the Qubbat al-Sahra—the Dome of the Rock.</p>
