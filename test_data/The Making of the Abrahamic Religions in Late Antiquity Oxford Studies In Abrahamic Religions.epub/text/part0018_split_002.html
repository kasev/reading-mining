<p class="parafl">It is in the context of <i class="calibre1">entpolitisiert</i> Judaism that Christianity was born. In this case things were even worse as the Christians had lost even that modicum of recognition that was given to the Jews by the Romans on behalf of their own traditions, their <i class="calibre1">patrioi nomoi</i>. Christians remained until Constantine followers of a <i class="calibre1">religio illicita</i>, while Jews retained certain rights as long as the Empire remained pagan.</p>
<p class="para">Jesus’s injunction in the Gospels: “Render unto Caesar…” (Matt. 22: 15–22; Mark 12: 13–17; Luke 20: 20–6), is the obvious starting point for any discussion of the conception of the relationship between “church” and “state” in early Christianity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-7" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> Two fundamentally different attitudes would evolve from the radical distinction between the realm of Caesar and that of God. On the one hand, one could argue that if the two realms have nothing in common, then the duties to the first do not contradict those to the second. The radical distinction between the two realms renders an arrangement between religious and political authorities possible. Until the fourth century, Christian thinkers would all reiterate the radical nature of Christian life, to be understood only in contradistinction or even direct opposition to the evil powers of this world. The different dualistic and Gnostic trends, in this sense, reflect the most clearly expressed theoretical attitude among Christians. Vis-à-vis the “earthly city” (<i class="calibre1">civitas terrena</i>), more or less identified, since John’s Apocalypse, with Satan’s realm, only the “city of God” (<i class="calibre1">civitas Dei</i>), the true realm in which Christians are citizens, stood firm. There was no third possibility: <i class="calibre1">tertium non datur</i>. The only alternative was that of behavior. Both a passive and an active attitude vis-à-vis the evil rulers of this world could be developed. The passive attitude reflected in the Gospel’s injunction quoted above could also be adopted by Gnostic thinkers: in the attempt to escape the evil powers which rule the world, all means can be considered legitimate.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-8" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> Paying Caesar his due does not legitimize his power; rather, it permits avoiding his wrath. A similar attitude of cryptic religious identity will be repeated, in different guises, by both Muslims and Jews in various historical contexts. In Shi’ite Islam, such an attitude is known as <i class="calibre1">taqiya</i>, hiding one’s true beliefs when under the political rule of Sunni enemies. In medieval Christian Spain (as well as under the Almohads), the prohibition of Judaism would lead to the phenomenon of crypto-Jews (commonly called in a Christian context Marannos), outwardly <span id="page_127"></span>Christians (or Muslims), but retaining their Jewish beliefs (as well as some practices) in secret.</p>
<p class="para">Activist behavior, probably less common among early Christians than passive, would have a stronger impact on Christian self-perception, however: accepting, or even seeking, martyrdom in order to affirm one’s faith in the face of religious intolerance and persecution. A particularly clear example of such behavior, highlighting its direct implications for political power, is offered by the <i class="calibre1">Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs</i>. This text, the earliest Latin Christian document to have reached us, refers to a hearing which took place at Carthage on 17 July 180.</p>
<p class="para">The proconsul Saturninus addresses the Christian Speratus in the following terms:</p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">If you begin to malign our sacred rites, I shall not listen to you. But swear rather by the Genius of our lord the emperor.</p>
</div>
<p class="parafl">Speratus answers:</p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">I do not recognize the empire of this world. Rather, I serve that God whom no man has seen, nor can see, with these eyes. I have not stolen; and on any purchase I pay the tax, for I acknowledge my lord who is the emperor of kings and of all nations.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-9" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre5">9</sup></a></p>

<p class="parafl">As we have seen, the radical opposition to political power exemplified in this text was not the only possible attitude before Constantine. And yet, it reflects the fact that, for early Christians, the sphere of politics and that of religion had little in common. In such a context, the very idea of theocracy seems quite preposterous. It would take Constantine’s revolution, and its theological interpretation by Eusebius of Caesarea, to imagine the Roman emperor as the representative of God upon earth. Eusebius wrote his <i class="calibre1">Tricennalia</i> on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of Constantine’s reign. Referring to this text, Polymnia Athanassiadi has recently noted, <i class="calibre1">en passant</i>, that it anticipates the concept of the caliphate.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-10" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> This off-hand remark is worth reflecting upon. If one sees earliest Islam within the broad picture of late antiquity, it stands to reason to assume that many of the characteristics of Islam in its earliest stages did not appear <i class="calibre1">ex nihilo</i>, but might be better understood within the background of late antique religious phenomena. More precisely, as we have noted <span id="page_128"></span>previously, and as we shall see in <a href="part0020_split_000.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9" class="calibre3">Chapter 8</a>, contemporary research emphasizes, besides traditional paganism, the importance of monotheistic trends in religious thought in the Arabian peninsula, at least since the fourth century.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-11" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">For early Christian views of the relationship between state and religion, then, one must make a radical distinction between the pre-Constantinian and the post-Constantinian periods. Before Constantine, it remained a matter of the eschatological future. And yet, even after the conversion of the Empire, at a time when theocracy had become the common state of affairs, the idea would never become quite natural in Christianity. Indeed, traces of the radical opposition between the realm of God and that of political power never completely disappeared.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-12" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> This was the case everywhere, although the tension between the political and the religious authorities would be expressed in rather different ways in Byzantium and in the medieval West.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-13" href="part0018_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-8-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a></p>
