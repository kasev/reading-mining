<p class="parafl">John of Damascus (<i class="calibre1">c</i>.676–749) was the last of the great Greek patristic authors, and the first Christian writer to refer to the doctrines of incipient Islam, which he calls “the religion of the Ismaelites (<i class="calibre1">hē…thrēskeia tōn Ismaēlitōn</i>), at the end of his book <i class="calibre1">On Heresies</i>, where it appears as chapter (or Heresy) 100.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-20" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> John’s perception of early Islam is quite parallel to the Jewish perception of early Christianity, according to Justin’s testimony. In both cases, the new religion is endowed with an ambiguous status, a heresy rather than a religion in its own right. The new religion of the Ishmaelites, or Agarenes, sets itself quite clearly outside Christianity: they follow another prophet; they possess a new scripture. And yet, in Christian consciousness, there is simply no room for another, independent monotheistic religion. One is either a Christian (orthodox or heretic) or a pagan. Judaism itself is conceived as misunderstood Christianity, as it were. Similarly, one can hardly <span id="page_196"></span>accuse the Arab followers of their new religion of polytheism. Now, polytheism is precisely the accusation brandished by the Muslims against the Christians, since Trinitarian doctrine reflects <i class="calibre1">shirk</i>: “association” (of other gods) to the Divinity. John nonetheless manages to accuse the Muslims both of “mutilating God” by taking the Logos from Him and of being idolaters through their veneration of the Meccan Ka’aba.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-21" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> For John, Muhammad (<i class="calibre1">Mamed</i>), the false prophet of the Arabs, concocted his own heresy (<i class="calibre1">idian sunestēsato hairesin</i>), partly under the influence of an Arian monk.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-22" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> He refers to the Qur’anic Docetic conception according to which the Jews “neither killed nor crucified him, but it was made to appear so unto them (<i class="calibre1">wa-lākin shubbiha lahum</i>).” In John’s words, “The Jews only crucified [Jesus’s] shadow (<i class="calibre1">tēn skian autou</i>).”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-23" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a> It stands to reason that early Islam was conversant with all the religious ideas of the world in which it was born.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-24" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> Yet, we must seek to identify the proximate channels through which such ideas reached the Qur’an. While one should not expect such a quest to reach a single source, it stands to reason that Jewish-Christians, whom we know were still in existence in the seventh century, and also, perhaps, “Abrahamists,” must be counted among these proximate channels.</p>
<p class="para">The Syriac <i class="calibre1">Colloquium of Patriarch John with the Emir of the Agarians</i> preserves a summary of a discussion on religious principles held in 639 between the Muslim Emir and John, the Monophysite patriarch, whom the Emir had summoned.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-25" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a> To the Emir’s question on the religion of Abraham and Moses, John answers: “Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and the other prophets had and maintained the faith of the Christians.” This remarkable sentence shows both the major importance granted to Abraham and the patriarchs by the first leaders of the Muslim community and the unwavering <span id="page_197"></span>attitude of the Christians, since, at least, the days of Justin Martyr: Abraham was a Christian; that is, Christianity is the true religion of Abraham.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-26" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a></p>
