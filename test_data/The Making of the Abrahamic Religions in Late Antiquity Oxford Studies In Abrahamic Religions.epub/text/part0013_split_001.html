<p class="parafl">The last chapter ended with the chain of late antique prophecy, culminating with that of Muhammad. We shall now seek to understand more precisely the phenomenon of late antique prophecy and its evolution. More precisely, we shall focus here on the idea of false prophecy in the <i class="calibre1">longue durée</i> of late antique Christianity. Prophecy belongs to religious enthusiasm, in the strong sense of the word, and reflects the total possession of the individual by the divine spirit. While various religious systems give a significant place to religious enthusiasm, all seek to limit its legitimacy.</p>
<p class="para">Extravagant behavior within ecstatic or charismatic movements is well known in the ancient world. The frenzy of the Bacchic maenads comes immediately to mind. Ecstasy, or trance, on the part of religious virtuosi is also a well-known phenomenon.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-1" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> E. R. Dodds noted long ago that the connection of prophecy and madness is as old as the religion of Apollo: “If the Greeks were right in connecting <i class="calibre1">mantis</i> with <i class="calibre1">mainomai</i>—and most philologists think they were—the association of prophecy and madness belongs to the Indo-European stock of ideas.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-2" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> What Dodds did not say, however, is that the same closeness between prophecy and madness can be observed in a Semitic context. Israelite prophecy is here a classic example, with its connections with madness: “…for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet…” [<i class="calibre1">le-khol ish meshugaʿ u-mitnabe</i>], says Jeremiah (29:26), while Hosea (9:7) refers to “the prophet [who] is a fool, the spiritual man [who] is mad…” [<i class="calibre1">evil ha-navi, meshugaʿ ish ha-ruah</i>].</p>
<p class="para">The false prophet, who uses his gifts <i class="calibre1">in malam partem</i>, is the natural complement of the true prophet, its negative counter-figure, as it were. It is also more directly connected to “madness.” While the figure of the prophet has <span id="page_60"></span>been the topic of a great many studies, that of the false prophet is certainly in need of further investigation. Such an investigation might permit a better understanding of the function of prophets in ancient religions, and of its transformation in late antiquity. Herodotus tells us that Scythian kings did not hesitate to execute any <i class="calibre1">pseudomantis</i> who had brought an unjust death sentence on somebody (IV.69). The concept of <i class="calibre1">pseudoprophētēs</i> appears in the Septuagint (LXX), but not in the Hebrew Bible, where there is no mention of <i class="calibre1">nevi sheker</i>—in Hebrew the concept would appear only later.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-3" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In the Hebrew Bible, the first <i class="calibre1">locus classicus</i> dealing with the figure of the misleading prophet, who deserves death, is Deuteronomy 13: 2–6; (cf. Deut. 18: 20):</p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">If there arise among you a prophet (<i class="calibre1">navi</i>; LXX <i class="calibre1">pseudoprophētēs</i>), or a dreamer of dreams, and gives thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke unto thee, saying, “Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them,” thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams…And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God…</p>
</div>
<p class="parafl">Similarly, in Jeremiah (6: 13) we read:</p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet [<i class="calibre1">navi</i>, LXX <i class="calibre1">pseudoprophētēs</i>] even unto the priest every one deals falsely.</p>
</div>
<p class="parafl">The link so clearly underlined by Deuteronomy between false prophecy and dream signals the deep suspicion towards dreams in both the Jewish and the Christian tradition. For Christian as for Jewish thinkers, dreams are more often than not considered as coming from Satan rather than stemming from a divine origin.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-4" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The oldest text where one finds <i class="calibre1">neviei shikra</i> is a fragment from Qumran (4Q 339) which quotes a list of false prophets of Israel, of whom the first is Balaam <span id="page_61"></span>ben Pe’or and the last seems to be Horkenos.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-5" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> The concept reappears later, in the midrashic literature of late antiquity. If these prophets are false prophets, this is either because they call men to the service of other gods, or because their prophecies are not realized, or else because they are not worthy from a moral point of view, that is, because their problematic personal conduct prevents considering them as speaking in the name of God (see for instance Deut. 13: 1–6).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-6" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The false prophet draws the boundaries of legitimate prophecy. Its figure and function can permit a more precise understanding of the role of prophets in the early stages of the new religion.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-7" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> It might also help us to understand more precisely the ways in which monotheistic systems retain implicit mediums for change.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-8" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> It would be an error to understand early Christian prophecy only within the framework of biblical prophecy. One should not ignore the importance of various paths of divination, oracles, and prophecies in the Roman Empire. In the second century, Lucian devoted the longest of his essays to a man whom he considered to be a religious charlatan. He calls Alexander, the impostor of Abonoteichos, a false prophet, <i class="calibre1">pseudomantis</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-9" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> This Alexander has been also compared to his contemporary Montanus. Robin Lane Fox, for instance, argues that Montanus shows more religious imagination than Alexander.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-10" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Since the LXX and Philo, biblical false prophets were identified in Hellenistic Judaism with pagan prophets. One can ask, however, whether the prominence of false prophecy and its juxtaposition with true prophecy is not typical of biblical monotheism, a radically simplified religious world in which the uniqueness of truth and of its source entails the existence, side by side with <span id="page_62"></span>truth, of error and lie, in a way quite unknown in polytheistic systems. In a polytheist climate, a false prophet is simply a religious charlatan. In a monotheistic climate, on the other hand, any prophet who does not represent orthodoxy is a false prophet.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-11" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a> Hence, the dual opposition between true and false prophet is a characteristic of monotheist systems which has no real parallel in polytheist religions.</p>
