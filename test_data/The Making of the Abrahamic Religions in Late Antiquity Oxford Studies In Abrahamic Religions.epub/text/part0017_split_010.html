<p class="parafl">What Jews and Christians had in common was, of course, first and foremost, Jewish Scripture (although Christians read it only in translation). But the Bible was also what divided them. To a great extent the history of the cultural <span id="page_117"></span>relationships between them is the history of Jewish–Christian polemics in their biblical exegesis. Much has been said about Jewish influences on Christian exegesis in late antiquity. Günter Stemberger has duly noted the “highly excessive claims” made in the early days of scholarship regarding the dependence of the church fathers on the rabbis. On the other hand, he adds, possible Christian influences on Jewish exegesis in late antiquity have never been explored in a systematic way. To be sure, it must not be assumed that the relationship was symmetrical.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-26" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a> Altogether, it is probable that more information flowed from Jews to Christians than vice versa, either directly (both Origen and Jerome, to name two obvious cases, tell us of their use of Jewish “native informants”) or indirectly (echoes of <i class="calibre1">midrashim</i> in Aphrahat or of Philo in Ambrose, for instance).</p>
<p class="para">While concern with Judaism was central to Christian theology, the reverse is not true. Yet, the Jews surely were painfully conscious of the obvious success of Christianity, which had first claimed their scripture, then conquered the empire, and finally begun to humiliate them in some very concrete ways. Similarly, they must have been aware of the way in which Christian theologians interpreted at least some crucial biblical texts. Hence, in some cases, Jewish biblical interpretation reflects—and is meant to refute—Christian perceptions.</p>
<p class="para">It has recently been argued that if Jewish life seems to have been so flourishing in Byzantine Palestine, this is because the Christianization of the Empire was one of the main causes of what Schwartz calls “the re-judaization of the Jews.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-27" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-27" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">27</sup></a> At the same time as the emperors marginalized Jews, they empowered them. In other words, in the pagan Roman Empire, Jews were much less limited in the spectrum of possible cultural and religious postures. For them, eclecticism meant acculturation. The emperor promoted religious rigidity and uniformity among Christians, through the definition as heretical of any deviant teaching or behavior (with its radical legal consequences). This attitude also had an effect on Jews, now defined, more than ever before, as a community. In this community, too, the process of “orthodoxization” forced aside and sought to erase every attempt at deviance. It is only in the fourth century, then, that we may speak of the emergence of a single Jewish culture. Similarly, Martin Goodman has spoken of the end of the fourth century as representing, for Jews, “the end of uncertainty.” Until then, he argues, one should retain serious skepticism about the applicability of rabbinic evidence outside the immediate circles of the rabbis.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-28" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_118"></span>Schwartz’s powerful argument sees in the Jewish cultural explosion of late antiquity a response, in some complex ways, to the gradual Christianization of the Roman Empire. Yet, his study does not account for the significance of the Talmudic movement, at the same time, in Babylonia. While we have no archaeological remains of the Babylonian Jewish communities, we may assume that the cultural blossoming reflected by the Babylonian Talmud was not singularly literary. We must also look for cultural interaction between Jews and Christians in the Sasanian Empire. There such interaction can perhaps be studied more easily (although only in a rather speculative way, alas, as the sources are terribly scarce), since we are dealing with two rather comparable minorities. In this context, it may be worth referring to the name for Christians in Pehlevi: <i class="calibre1">tarsak</i> (lit. “fearer”). Shlomo Pines has proposed that we see in this name a trace of the origins of Christianity in Iran, which would have developed through the Jewish communities there.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-29" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a> Mesopotamian Jews and Christians shared the same language, Aramaic, a major fact which goes a long way in explaining their cultural relationship in the East. Indeed, as J. B. Segal noted long ago:</p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">The early advance of Christianity in Mesopotamia was upon ground already prepared by the Jews. It was in a great degree the intellectual and cultural resources of Mesopotamian Jewry that enabled the Aramean strain in the Church of Edessa to stand aloof from the violent theological controversies that took place before the fifth century.</p>

<p class="parafl">Segal adds that “in the course of time, the Jewish and the Christian communities had moved far apart.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-30" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a> We should look for cultural interaction between Jews and Christians in Babylonia not only in explicit theology and hermeneutics, but also in mystical theology and praxis.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-33"></span>
