<p class="parafl">The idea of this book took form during my tenure as Professor of the Study of the Abrahamic Religions at Oxford (2009–14). As the first holder of the chair, I sought to represent in a new light aspects of late antique religious history, on which I had been working for a few decades. It struck me that some patterns later to be identified as ‘Abrahamic’ were already present during the first centuries <span class="sc">ce</span>, as Jews and Christians were vying for the title of the true inheritors of Abraham. The book’s main argument, then, is that it is in the religious history of late antiquity that we should look, if we wish to understand the genesis of Islam better.</p>
<p class="para">The book’s ten chapters (most of them published previously in a different version) tackle different issues of this central problem. Although much has already been written on aspects of the problem, it is fair to say more work is needed before a synthetic study can be attempted. At this stage, it is important to realize that the birth of Islam must be seen as an integral part of late antiquity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-miscMatter-6-note-1" href="part0005.html#acprof-9780198738862-miscMatter-6-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> Without developing a teleological approach, it is possible to analyze the trajectories of concepts and thought patterns that rendered conversion to Islam, on a large scale, possible in the seventh century and afterwards, throughout the Near East.</p>
<p class="para">During the long period of gestation of this book a great number of colleagues have helped me formulate my views, in a number of ways. I am most grateful to them all, although I might not be able to mention them all. At Oxford, Moshe Blidstein, Markus Bockmuehl, Dame Averil Cameron, Beate Dignas, Mark Edwards, Martin Goodman, Neil McLynn, Sir Fergus Millar, Robert Parker, Nicolai Sinai, were my main interlocutors. Other colleagues and friends from various places, Nicole Belayche, Corrine Bonnet, Jan Bremmer, Patricia Crone, Ronnie Goldstein, Yonatan Moss, John Scheid, Shaul Shaked, and Sarah Stroumsa have discussed various aspects of the problems tackled in chapters of this book. So had the late Sabine MacCormack and Evelyne Patlagean. Thanks to their remarks, this book is probably less inadequate than it would have been.</p>
<p class="para">My gratitude also goes to Rami Schwartz, who has been extremely helpful in preparing the final manuscript for the press and compiling the index, and to Donald Watt, for his precious help in reading the proofs.</p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_viii"></span>Finally, I should like to honor the memory of the Saudi benefactor who endowed the Chair for the Study of the Abrahamic Religions at Oxford (and wished to remain anonymous). For him, scholarship has a role to play in the fight against religious bigotry among the children of Abraham. His vision has sustained me during dark hours of violence and hatred.</p>
