<h1 class="h" id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-titleGroup-58"><span class="title1"><span>I</span></span></h1><p class="parafl">It is to the Irish freethinker John Toland (1668–1722) that we owe the concept of Jewish-(or Judaeo-)Christianity. In 1718, Toland published, in London, <i class="calibre1">Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity</i>. This text further developed ideas first presented in his French manuscript written in 1710, <i class="calibre1">Christianisme judaïque et mahométan</i>, which sought to offer a historical argument, recognizing the Jewish roots of Christianity in order to promote the toleration of Jews in modern European societies.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-1" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Toland based his argument upon the <i class="calibre1">Gospel of Barnabas</i>, an apocryphal writing of unknown date, the full text of which we only possess in an Italian version of a lost Spanish one. This text announces the coming of Muhammad and makes reference to the <i class="calibre1">shahāda</i>, the Muslim profession of faith. According to the <i class="calibre1">Gospel of Barnabas</i>, Jesus is a prophet, not the Son of God, and does not <span id="page_140"></span>die on the cross. In his stead, it is Judas Iscariot who is crucified.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-2" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> A human, rather than a divine Jesus, and a Docetist conception of the Passion: these traits are typical of the figure of Jesus both for Jewish-Christians and in the Qur’an. For Toland, some of the fundamental doctrines of Islam are rooted in the “most ancient monuments of the Christian religion,” and not in the views of the Nestorian monk Sergius.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-3" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a> It is to Toland’s refutation by the Lutheran orthodox theologian Lorenz von Mosheim (1693–1755), <i class="calibre1">Vindiciae antiquae christianiorum disciplinae</i>, published in 1720, that Toland’s book owed its fame and the concept of Jewish-Christianity its survival. Ferdinand Christian Baur (1792–1860), the founder of the Tübingen school of New Testament studies, made <i class="calibre1">Judenchristentum</i> a cornerstone of his conception of Christian origins. For the Hegelian that he was, second-century Christianity represented the synthesis or sublimation (<i class="calibre1">Aufhebung</i>) of Petrine Christianity and Paulinian (“gentile”) Christianity. For most historians of early Christianity, it is Baur, rather than Toland, who is at the origin of the concept of Jewish-Christianity, a phenomenon that would be studied, from Baur on, only in the first Christian centuries. Toland’s intuition, according to which one of the earliest manifestations of Christianity, having survived late antiquity, had a major impact upon the earliest stages of Islam, and hence on the world history of religions, practically disappeared from the horizon of research. The patristic sources do not speak, of course, of “Jewish-Christianity.” From the second to the fourth centuries, the patristic heresiographers usually mention the Ebionites (<i class="calibre1">ebionitoi</i>), whose name was thought to have come from their imaginary founder, a certain Ebion. In fact, it comes from their insistence upon the spiritual value of poverty: they call themselves <i class="calibre1">evvyonim</i> (“poor” in Hebrew), a biblical term they borrowed from Psalms. The Christian heresiographers also mention other names of sects, in particular those of the Nazoreans (<i class="calibre1">nazoraioi</i>), who share, at least partly, Ebionite ideas. For the Nazoreans, Jesus was, rather than God’s Son, a prophet, the last of a long chain of true prophets, starting with Adam, in which each true prophet is preceded by a false prophet. Moreover, Jesus had not died on the cross; the heresiographers often associate this Docetism with other doctrines of Jewish-Christian groups.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-4" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_141"></span>Historiographic revisionism is fashionable today. One often questions the usefulness of some of our concepts, such as Gnosticism, for a better understanding of historical realities. Thus, for example, Daniel Boyarin has expressed serious doubts concerning the possibility of speaking of “Judaism” (<i class="calibre1">Ioudaismos</i>) before the fourth century <span class="sc">ce</span>. For him, Jewish beliefs and practices are defined as such by patristic theologians. In consequence, rather than reflecting historical reality, they reveal more about those using them.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-5" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> And since Boyarin believes that the concept of “Judaism” is not valid in this period, he also proposes to abandon the concept of Jewish-Christianity, without suggesting a clear alternative. But a historical phenomenon needs to be named if one is to study it.</p>
<p class="para">Methodological remarks are always necessary and often useful. In the present case, however, I fail to see what one gains by replacing one concept with another. This is not the place for examining or refuting Boyarin’s approach. Suffice it here to say that, in any domain, research demands an intellectual effort to identify common denominators of various phenomena (for instance, multiple religious sects and groups). Such common denominators allow us to retrace central trends underlying the complexity of observable reality. One cannot fulfill this task without creating categories, the primary justification of which is their heuristic usefulness. Gnosticism and Jewish-Christianity are examples of such categories, which cannot be abandoned, although they must be used with care, without forgetting what they are not: a truthful representation of historical reality. In particular, these categories do not reflect clearly identifiable groups. Thus, it is often among Jewish-Christians (or in Jewish-Christian texts or traditions) that we can find some easily identifiable Gnostic theologoumena, such as Docetism.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-6" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">By Jewish-Christianity, I mean the faith of Jews who believed that Jesus was the Messiah announced by the prophets, but did not give up traditional Jewish religious practice. For Origen, in the first half of the third century, these Jewish-Christians, who wished to be at once Jews and Christians, succeeded in being neither Jews nor Christians. One should note that the Jewish sources are singularly less prolix than the Christian ones: for the rabbis, the best way of dealing with their enemies was to “kill them by silence.” Contemporary scholars thus rely on the perception of the patristic <span id="page_142"></span>sources, for which these archaic heretics had practically disappeared before the end of the fourth century. Consequently, most contemporary scholars treat the existence of Jewish-Christian communities beyond the first centuries with deep skepticism.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-7" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">And yet, the Jewish-Christians of antiquity (who are unrelated to the contemporary “Jews for Jesus,” whose theology is that of evangelical Christianity) do not seem to have disappeared from the late antique scene. The sources (or at least the reliable ones) are quite scarce and hard to interpret. Another method, then, is needed in order to detect the presence of Jewish-Christians. In particular, one should at once use common sense and offer a careful interpretation of indirect sources. To be sure, late antique Jewish-Christian communities must have been small, marginal groups, often living in a protected isolation. As far as I know, there is no clear-cut and irrefutable proof of their existence in the seventh century. But the traces they left provide enough circumstantial evidence to let us assume their continued existence long after the end of the fourth century (when Epiphanius and Jerome testify unambiguously to their presence) and their <i class="calibre1">Fortleben</i>. John of Damascus mentions, in the early eighth century, the existence “to this day” of a Jewish-Christian Elchasaite group, the Sampseans, on the shores of the Dead Sea.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-8" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> His testimony is usually rejected by scholars, as he repeats what Epiphanius of Salamis had written in the fourth century. And yet, one must remember that John writes from the monastery of Mar Saba, in the Judean wilderness, a place very close to the Dead Sea (a few kilometers as the crow flies). It is improbable that John’s mention of heretics living on the shores of the Dead Sea does not refer to a concrete reality. The very late existence of such groups, however, is less striking than the impact they may have had far beyond their own boundaries.</p>
<p class="para">Among the various theories on the origins of Islam, those involving the Jewish-Christians seem fashionable today. This may be a bit puzzling since Toland’s <i class="calibre1">Nazarenus</i> was for all practical purposes forgotten long ago. It is the liberal theologian and great historian of early Christianity Adolf von Harnack (1851–1930) who seems to be at the origin of the present trend of thought. In a few pages of his <i class="calibre1">Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte</i>, he had proposed identifying in some Jewish-Christian theologoumena some of the most important sources <span id="page_143"></span>of earliest Islam.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-9" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> Harnack, who had no particular interest in Islam, concurred with Toland through his intuition on the similarity between prophecy and Docetism in the Qur’an (Q. 4.157) and among the Ebionites. To these remarks of Harnack one should add those of Ernest Renan and Daniel Chwolson, in two studies published in the mid-nineteenth century, to which we shall return below.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-10" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> Thus, a number of Baptist and Jewish-Christian sects from the first centuries were brought to bear upon the study of Islamic origins.</p>
<p class="para">Over the years, Harnack’s intuition regarding Jewish-Christian origins was picked up and developed by a number of scholars—first by the New Testament scholar Adolf Schlatter and then, in particular, by Hans-Joachim Schoeps, the great specialist in Jewish-Christianity in the early centuries.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-11" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a> The most serious difficulty of this thesis on the Jewish-Christian impact on the Qur’an, however, remained the fact that our documentation on Jewish-Christian communities rarely goes beyond the fourth century. With no chronological and geographical proximity, the structural similarities between Jewish-Christian theology and some Qur’anic verses remained parallelisms, certainly interesting from a phenomenological viewpoint, but useless for explaining the transmission of these theologoumena to the Qur’an. Thanks to a series of discoveries and studies, our knowledge of the early Jewish-Christians has now become more precise. We now know that some Jewish-Christian communities may have survived, at least in Palestine, until the Muslim conquests.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-12" href="part0020_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-9-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> It is certainly not far-fetched to imagine a possible Jewish-Christian presence in late antique Hijaz.</p>
<p class="para">Rather than offering a new theory, I should like to offer here a <i class="calibre1">status quaestionis</i>, adding some methodological and epistemological reflections on the way in which the question is framed today for the historian of late antique religion. Obviously, I make no claims here on the redaction of the Qur’an or <span id="page_144"></span>the formation of Islam, but deal only with aspects of the religious background of the Qur’an. As in the case of Christianity or Manichaeism, Islam permits us to observe how a religion is born, although we know infinitely more about the birth of Christianity than about that of Islam.</p>
