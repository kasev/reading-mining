<p class="parafl">Mani, the “prophet of light” from third-century Mesopotamia, considered as a false prophet and an arch-heretic by Christian heresiologists, has already appeared here. Mani became the founder of a radically dualist religion whose missionaries succeeded in establishing Manichaean communities from the Western Mediterranean to China. In some places, these communities survived for a whole millennium. There is no reason not to include Manichaeism, side by side with other religious trends of late antiquity, in the religious worldviews that had a significant impact upon the formation of the Qur’an and Islamic origins. This chapter will essentially probe one specific trail in this respect.</p>
<p class="para">Only once is Muhammad referred to as “seal of the prophets” in the whole Qur’an: “Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but the Apostle of God (<i class="calibre1">rasūl Allah</i>) and the seal of the prophets (<i class="calibre1">khātam al-nabiyyīn</i>)” (Qur’an 33: 40). Yet, this conception is of cardinal theological significance in Islam. The usual interpretation of the expression, both in traditional Islamic exegesis and in modem scholarship, takes it to signify “the last prophet” to be sent by God to mankind.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-1" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In his analysis of the Qur’anic expression, Arthur Jeffery has surmised that it “may have been…already familiar to [Muhammad’s] contemporaries.” He points out that out that, in Arabic, <i class="calibre1">khātam</i> is a loanword from Aramaic, and <span id="page_88"></span>that already in Christianity the message of Jesus is implicitly considered to be the final prophetic revelation.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-2" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> Jeffery points out, however, that, only Mani explicitly claimed to be the last in the succession of messengers of God, adding that “in the Arabic sources it is recorded that his followers called him ‘the Seal of the Prophets.’ ”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-3" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The fact that this actual wording is to be found only from the pen of Muslim doxographers and heresiologists should in itself call for our suspicion.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-4" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> Yet, a pre-Islamic Manichaean attribution of the metaphor to Mani remains a possibility, and a review of the evidence is called for. In order to do so, I shall first seek to analyze the nature of the metaphorical use of “seal” in Manichaean parlance and then deal with the concepts of prophecy and apostleship in Manichaean writings. This analysis, it is hoped, will help to reconstruct the <i class="calibre1">Vorgeschichte</i> of the Qur’anic expression.</p>
<p class="para">In the chapter of his <i class="calibre1">Athār al-Bāqiya</i> dealing with false prophets, al-Bīrūnī (d. ca. 1050 <span class="sc">ce</span>/<span class="sc">ah</span> 442) quotes verbatim the opening sentences of Mani’s only Iranian work, the <i class="calibre1">Šābuhragān:</i></p>
<div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">Wisdom and deeds have always from time to time been brought to mankind by the messengers of God (<i class="calibre1">rusul allah)</i>. So in one age they have been brought by the messenger (<i class="calibre1">rasūl</i>) called Buddha to India, in another by Zaradusht to Persia, in another by Jesus to the West. Thereupon this revelation has come down, this prophecy (<i class="calibre1">nubūwwa</i>) in this last age through me, Mani, the messenger of the God of Truth (<i class="calibre1">rasūl illāh al-haqq</i>) to Babylonia.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-5" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre5">5</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="parafl">After this quotation, the <i class="calibre1">Ustadh</i> adds—but this time without quoting verbatim—that, in his gospel, Mani “says that he is the Paraclete announced by the Messiah, and that he is the seal of the prophets (<i class="calibre1">khātam al-nabiyyīn</i>).”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-6" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> Although al-Bīrūnī’s intellectual integrity is not to be questioned, one cannot exclude the possibility that here he might be paraphrasing Mani’s contention by using the Qur’anic expression rather than reporting it quite accurately. The following pages will seek to unveil what al-Bīrūnī could have read in Mani’s gospel (probably in an Iranian translation) and in other Manichaean <span id="page_89"></span>writings which led him, bona fide, to report that Mani called himself <i class="calibre1">khātam al-nabiyyīn</i>.</p>
<p class="para">The other Arabic sources are even less compelling evidence.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-7" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> Shahrastānī (d. 1053 <span class="sc">ce</span>/<span class="sc">ah</span> 547) only reports “and then must come the Seal of the Prophets,” a sentence interpolated with the addition of “in the land of the Arabs.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-8" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> Ibn al-Murtadā, analyzing a book written by the Manichaean leader Yazdānbakht, says that Mani appeared as “the seal of the prophets,” that is, at the end of a series of prophets beginning with Adam, and including, together with Seth and Noah, Buddha, Zarādusht, and Jesus.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-9" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> Yet, the fact that Yazdānbakht lived in the ninth century, in the time of al-Ma’mūn (according to Ibn al-Nadīm’s explicit testimony in his important chapter on Manichaeism in the <i class="calibre1">Fihrist)</i>,<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-10" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> disqualifies his testimony as a reflection of a pre-Islamic Manichaean use of the actual phrase “seal of the prophets” with reference to Mani. It stands to reason that in the Islamic realm, the Manichaeans insisted that Mani, rather than Muhammad, had been <i class="calibre1">khātam al-nabiyyīn</i>. The same argument holds for Abu al-Ma‘ali, who reports that it is in a book written in Persian towards the end of the eleventh century that Mani was called “seal of the prophets.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-11" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a></p>
