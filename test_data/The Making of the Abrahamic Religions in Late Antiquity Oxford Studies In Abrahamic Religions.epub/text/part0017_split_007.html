<p class="parafl">Midrashic Hebrew literature is a literary genre <i class="calibre1">sui generis</i>, which was born in late antiquity and continued to develop throughout the Middle Ages. The fact that it was composed and redacted orally, and only later committed to writing, makes the exact dating of the texts quite difficult. Yet it is possible to establish that some of the earliest and most important collections of Midrashim date from Byzantine Palestine. It has been suggested, again recently by Nicholas de Lange, that the <i class="calibre1">Midrash</i> genre offers striking similarities to the series, or <i class="calibre1">catenae</i> (“chains”), of patristic interpretations of biblical texts.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-21" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> It so happens that the first <i class="calibre1">catenae</i> were also composed in late fifth-century or early sixth-century Palestine. Procopius of Gaza (ca 465–ca 530) apparently created this <span id="page_114"></span>genre, in which he worked the different exegetes into a sort of continuous interpretation, in which the wordings of all of them appeared.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-22" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> Some kind of contact between the two phenomena is plausible, but we must not forget their common ground: “secular” rather than “pagan” culture, as can be seen in Gaza. Only a comparative study, however, might be able to find an answer to the link between them.</p>
<p class="para">We are still far from understanding the mythopoietic process involved in the formation of midrashic literature. We do not even know their original purpose: were the collections of <i class="calibre1">midrashim</i> meant to be used as “raw material” for the preparation of homilies? Obviously, they were taught (and learned by heart) in rabbinic education, as they would not otherwise have been preserved before they were committed to writing. Various <i class="calibre1">midrashim</i> show at least a blurred consciousness of Christian doctrines. Does this indicate that they were redacted as offering a Jewish answer to Christian biblical interpretation? Similarly, we still do not know the original function of the <i class="calibre1">catenae</i>, although they may well have been used for homiletic purposes.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-30"></span>
