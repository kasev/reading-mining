<p class="parafl">Some of the leading religious figures of the long late antiquity, such as Marcus Magus, Montanus, Mani, and Muhammad, present themselves, each one in his turn, as heirs of the prophetic tradition, as ending the great chain of prophecy starting with the biblical prophets, and reaching its apex with the prophecy of Jesus. For their opponents, the patristic heresiologists, these religious leaders were all impostors, false prophets. Like wolves in sheep’s clothing (Matt. 7: 15), they knew how to hide their pretensions under the cover of their prophetic charisma. They were all the more dangerous for this ability, since they were able to attract naïve believers to their diabolical teachings. Even religions established upon prophecy seek to put an end to active prophecy. In any new religious movement, what Max Weber called routinization soon takes over charisma, permitting the establishment of religious elites. The famous discussion in the Talmud on the sage being superior to the prophet<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-12" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> reflects this issue very clearly: since the closing of the age of prophecy, the sages are the only ones able to interpret the divine word. Thus, in Rabbinic Judaism as well as in ancient Christianity, since the age of prophecy is officially closed, one finds relatively few discussions on “the signs of prophecy,” the criteria permitting to distinguish between true and false prophets. Yet, that Talmudic discussion also reflects the great difficulty, on the part of religious authorities, to close the channels of charisma.</p>
<p class="para">For both Jews and Christians, the time of prophecy was now closed, at least in theory, just like the canon of their scriptures. Both Judaism and Christianity recognized, in principle, the fact of ecstasy: some people were able to “go out of themselves,” to become united with the divinity, or to receive direct revelations from it. The need to draw some limits soon imposed itself, however. If ecstasy or prophecy comes too late, or from outside, or from a crooked inside, it is a wrong kind of prophecy. Ethics enters here the field of religion. The false prophet is the man who trespasses on established limits, following a traditional religious attitude, but whose legitimacy remains bound to the past. One can distinguish, <span id="page_63"></span>then, between two kinds of impostors who claim falsely to be prophets: depending on whether one can observe the activity of contemporary “true” prophets, or whether the period of prophecy is considered to be closed for ever.</p>
<p class="para">But this “closure” of the age of prophecy in early Christianity did not happen at once. Indeed, the oldest strata of Christianity reveal the important role played by the “ambulant charismatics,” those religious virtuosi of the first Christian generations studied by Gert Theissen, who insists on their similarities with Cynic philosophers. The early Christian prophets are one category of these ambulant charismatic teachers.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-13" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a> William Horbury, too, has noted the symmetry between the behavior of false prophets and that of itinerant philosophers such as the Cynics.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-14" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> Yet, despite many studies on the oldest Christian texts, from the gospels and Paul’s epistles to the <i class="calibre1">Didachē</i> and the <i class="calibre1">Shepherd</i> of Hermas, the role of Christian prophets in earliest Palestinian and Syrian Christianity remains rather uncertain. Scholars even disagree on the identity of the false prophets referred to by Matthew.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-15" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves (<i class="calibre1">prosechete apo tōn pseudoprophētōn hoitines erchontai pros humas en endumasin probatōn, esōthen de eisin lukoi harpages</i>),” Matt. 7: 15. This verse of the Sermon on the Mount is the main text from the gospels referring to the false prophets. In Matt. 24: 11, moreover, reference is made to the many false Christs and false apostles who will appear, luring believers. According to Hans Dieter Betz, the false prophets seem to have been Christians of pagan background, leaders of a Christianity of Paulinian type, freed from the Law. As noted by Betz, the expression “false prophets” is of course typical of a polemical discourse, but only, or at least in particular, within the monotheistic biblical tradition.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-16" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a> In such a perspective, the “false prophets” are the heretics from all sides, and the term is a collective term of opprobrium, similar to <i class="calibre1">minim</i>—a plurivalent term of opprobrium in rabbinic literature. Hence, there is no point in trying to identify them with any specific group, such as zealots, Pharisees, Essenes, “strict” Jewish-Christians, disciples of Paul, or antinomian Hellenists.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-17" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In primitive Christianity, prophets have a well-defined place, together with apostles and doctors (1 Cor. 12: 27–8). Together with the false prophets, one <span id="page_64"></span>will then find false doctors (2 Pet. 2: 1) and Antichrists (1 Jn 2: 18). Paul, in particular, insists on the gift of prophecy, which he includes among the spiritual gifts. “Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak in tongues.” (1 Cor. 14: 29). For him, prophets are superior to those who speak in tongues, since they communicate their spiritual experience to other men (1 Cor. 14: 3). The importance of prophecy in early Christian literature directly entails that of false prophecy. In his <i class="calibre1">Dialogue with Trypho</i>, Justin Martyr mentions different imitators of the prophets, sent by the devil to all peoples: the false prophets of Israel at the time of Elijah, the magi in Egypt (<i class="calibre1">sic</i>), other anonymous imitators in Greece.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-18" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a> Justin adds that the false prophets are not only a phenomenon of the past, but that they are still active in his day among Christians.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-19" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a> This text echoes the discussion on false prophets in the <i class="calibre1">Didachē,</i> where the different criteria presented to differentiate between true and false prophets deal with the morality of the prophet concerned: if he settles with his hosts for more than two days without working, if he asks to be paid for his services, if he preaches truth but does not put what he says into practice, then he is a false prophet.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-20" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> The same kind of argument can be found in the <i class="calibre1">Shepherd</i> of Hermas, <i class="calibre1">Mandate</i> 11.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-21" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> In <i class="calibre1">Mandate</i> 11.7, for instance, the differentiation between the true and the false prophet is based upon their way of life (<i class="calibre1">apo tēs zōēs</i>). He who lives according to the Spirit will be meek, calm, and humble, and will avoid all evilness and low desire of this world (<i class="calibre1">Mandate</i> 11.8). The false prophet, on the other hand, is impudent, shameless, overly talkative, he lives in luxury, and demands to be paid for his prophecy (<i class="calibre1">Mandate</i> 11.12). Origen, however, tackles the same issue from a very different angle. In his <i class="calibre1">Contra Celsum</i>, he argues that ecstasy, madness, possession, and the loss of consciousness are all different elements indicating false prophecy. The true prophet retains a clear vision of things, even when he is in communion with the divinity, precisely because he refuses to let himself fall into an ecstatic state. Such an ecstasy is only too common in our cities, notes Origen, who mentions various kinds of prophets active in different cities.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-22" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Marc the Gnostic, or Marcus Magus, was one of the early followers of Valentinus, around the middle of the second century.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-23" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a> He is presented by <span id="page_65"></span>Irenaeus (who writes in the 180s) as a Gnostic Casanova of sorts, as Giovanni Filoramo has called him, a false prophet acting in guile and concocting love potions and magical charms in order to seduce beautiful and rich—but naïve—women.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-24" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> After having offered them wine, Marcus asks them to prophesy, and when they argue that they have no prophetic gifts, he tells them simply to utter meaningless syllables and sentences.

<p class="para">Montanus, a Phrygian ecstatic teacher who flourished in the second half of the second century, launched the most famous prophetic movement of early Christianity. The anonymous anti-Montanist source which has been preserved for us thanks to Eusebius is our primary source of information about that important millenarian movement, which seems to have remained a significant threat to mainstream Christianity throughout communities, in the West as well as in the East, and over a significant period of time.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-28" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a> Like Marcus Magus, Montanus behaves like an ecstatic, speaking “strangely” and prophesying in ways that do not fit Church norms. The ecstatic character of Montanus, which reflects madness, is in itself an indication of the false character of his prophecy.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-29" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a> According to Epiphanius, Montanus sees himself as being a divine incarnation: “I am the Lord, dwelling in a man.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-30" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a> Such a self-perception underlines the false character of his prophecy: such a prophet must be a deceiver (<i class="calibre1">planos</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-31" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-31" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">31</sup></a> His claim to be god reveals his possession by Satan. As is well known, and just as in Marcus’s movement, female ecstasy plays a leading role in his movement. Eusebius quotes Alcibiades the Christian, according to whom a prophet need not speak in ecstasy. Montanism remained <span id="page_66"></span>a violent sect for a long time: in the sixth century, Procopius will tell us how, during Justinian’s campaign to erase any expression of religious dissent, officials would force Phrygian Montanists to give up their ancestral beliefs, which led to scenes of collective suicide by fire.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-32" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-32" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">32</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Like Marcus Magus, Montanus reflects the continued presence of ecstatic phenomena among early Christian communities. Such phenomena were directly related to eschatological trends, but also to esoteric traditions. Despite the obvious importance of both the Gnostic and the Montanist challenges for early Christianity, it is among the Jewish-Christians, and in particular among the Ebionites, who seem to have represented the core of early Jewish Christianity, that the problem of true and false prophecy was most clearly formulated.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-33" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-33" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">33</sup></a> For the Ebionites, this question was of cardinal importance. For them, Jesus himself, who by nature was human rather than divine, appeared as a prophet, the last prophet of a long series starting with Adam, rather than God’s Messiah. It is, thus, upon the Ebionites that we should focus in order to understand the persistent recurrence of true and false prophecy throughout Near Eastern religious movements of late antiquity. Ebionite theology developed the concept of a “chain of prophets” throughout <i class="calibre1">Heilsgeschichte</i>. “They seek to comment on the prophecies with an excessive attention,” notes Irenaeus.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-34" href="part0013_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-4-note-34" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">34</sup></a></p>
