<p class="parafl">In order to assess the mutations of religion in the long late antiquity, one should probably focus first on what happened to the self during our period. Following Pierre Hadot, who had offered subtle analyses of what he called “spiritual exercises” in the practice of philosophy under the Empire, Michel Foucault sought in his later years to analyze “the care of the self” (<i class="calibre1">epimeleia heautou</i>) among ancient intellectuals.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-6" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> For him, the radical denigration of the body among early Christian thinkers and ascetics brought this care of the self to an end. It seems to me, however, that Foucault’s analysis is flawed in various ways. In particular, the corpus from which he drew his evidence was particularly limited (Foucault used mainly texts from Cassian’s interpretation of Egyptian monasticism). It is true, of course, that he did not have the time to broaden and fully develop his analysis. However, even if more time had been granted to him, he probably would not have been able to offer a convincing analysis of the psychological transformations accompanying the passage from paganism to Christianity. This is so, I argue, because of his attempt (an attempt he shares with many) to understand this passage as an internal transformation of the Greco-Roman world, thus ignoring the Jewish dimensions of Christianity. Arnaldo Momigliano, would have been a better guide here, as he recognized the triple matrix of intellectual and religious life under <span id="page_29"></span>the Empire: Jerusalem, together with Athens and Rome.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-7" href="part0010_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-2-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> Indeed, the oriental nature of early Christianity seems to remain often undervalued.</p>
<p class="para">A crucial psychological transformation occurred in our period, with the new recognition that what happened after death was so much more important than what happened to one in this life. This transformation, of course, was endowed with a religious nature, and would have far-reaching religious consequences. Think, for instance, of the profound differences between Marcus Aurelius’s <i class="calibre1">Meditations</i> and Augustine’s <i class="calibre1">Confessions</i>. Personal eschatology would soon change in some radical ways both attitudes towards the self and the foundations of ethics. <i class="calibre1">Askēsis</i>, the constant exercising through which one sought to work upon oneself, was then endowed with a new meaning. <i class="calibre1">Askēsis</i> now meant an attempt at re-forming rather than discovering oneself. Christian anthropology was built on some conceptions, both explicit and implicit, which entailed attitudes quite different from those of both Stoic and Platonic philosophies (the two main schools of thought in our period). These conceptions were directly inherited from the Hebrew Bible (more precisely, from its Greek translation, the Septuagint). One such conception was the idea (Gen. 1: 26) that man had been created in the image of God (<i class="calibre1">homo imago dei</i>). That usually entailed, in contradistinction to Platonic thought, the recognition of the intrinsic value of the human body. For most Christian thinkers, indeed, the nature of man encompassed both soul and body. Another one was the insistence on God’s transcendence: the whole cosmos had been created by Him <i class="calibre1">ex nihilo</i>. This entailed a refusal to accept the Platonist idea of a real parenthood, or <i class="calibre1">sungeneia</i>, between the soul and the divine. Although Christian intellectuals accepted for a very long time many of the intellectual assumptions of the Platonists, without recognizing that this would lead them into some serious self-contradictions, they usually stopped short of thinking that the human soul could, thanks to its <i class="calibre1">sungeneia</i> with the divine, reach deification (<i class="calibre1">theōsis</i>) at the end of the ascetical praxis. This praxis, rather, was usually conceived in the terms of an <i class="calibre1">imitatio Christi</i>, leading to sanctification, sometimes through martyrdom. In contradistinction to the <i class="calibre1">askēsis</i> of the philosophers, Christian <i class="calibre1">askēsis</i> (as well as Jewish <i class="calibre1">askēsis</i>) sought more a <i class="calibre1">metanoia</i> (Heb. <i class="calibre1">teshuva</i>) than an <i class="calibre1">epistrophē</i>, a repentance of one’s sins more than a turning over from matter to the divine.</p>
<p class="para">In the religious world of late antiquity, one can distinguish different ideal types (<i class="calibre1">Idealtypen</i>) of religious virtuosi. While the priest and the prophet seem <span id="page_30"></span>to have either disappeared or retreated into the background, the stage is mainly left to the sage, the Gnostic, and the saint. To be sure, all three characters appear at once in the major religious trends. It stands to reason, however, that the various traditions show different constellations between these <i class="calibre1">Idealtypen</i>. It seems to me that while the Jews hesitate mainly between the figure of the sage and that of the saint, the main figures for the Christians are that of the saint and that of the Gnostic, while “pagans” value mainly the figure of the sage and that of the Gnostic.</p>
<p class="para">For Christians and Jews, the revealed scriptures entailed a “dialogical” way of deciphering the self through a constant involvement with the scriptures (in particular, reading or recitation of the Psalms). The growth of religious conceptions based on a revealed book, in the centuries between Jesus and Muhammad, reflects indeed a major transformation of religion.</p>
