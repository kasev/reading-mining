<p class="parafl">According to the theory of “modes of religiosity” developed by the Oxford social and cognitive anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse, religious transmission essentially encompasses, in all societies, two very different sets of dynamics.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-25" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a> For him, the two essential modes of religiosity are the doctrinal mode and the imagistic one. The doctrinal mode involves the frequent repetition of teachings, relatively tame and expressed in words, and highly repetitive ritual performances. It entails the need for centralized authority and orthodoxy checks by religious leaders as the communities grow larger. In the imagistic mode, the infrequent repetition of rituals and beliefs ensures that <span id="page_51"></span>communities do not spread widely. Religious practice tends, in this mode, to be intense and emotionally arousing; no need here for official authority to ensure intense social cohesion. Whitehouse points out that the dichotomy of modes of religiosity recalls other taxonomies, and refers to the opposition between charismatic and routinized religion for Weber, the Apollonian versus the Dionysiac for Ruth Benedict, the literate versus the image-based for Ernest Gellner,<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-26" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-26" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">26</sup></a> the literate versus the non-literate for Jack Goody, or structure versus <i class="calibre1">communitas</i> for Victor Turner.</p>
<p class="para">Whitehouse offers a variation on a long-recognized duality among sociologists and anthropologists. Different religious communities, of course, will insist more on one or the other mode of religiosity. Yet, it is important to remember that no religious tradition can be established on a single mode of religiosity, which should rather be conceived as what Weber called <i class="calibre1">Idealtypen</i> (Whitehouse, for his part, speaks of “attractor positions”) never appearing <i class="calibre1">à l’état pur</i> in a historical context. For Whitehouse, indeed, the dynamics of religion are characterized by the combined action of the two modes of religiosity, rather than by the impact of a single mode. I should perhaps add that Whitehouse himself, as an anthropologist, is more conscious than most cognitive scientists of the need to show the applicability of models to particular ethnological or historical contexts, and has sought to show how the modes of religiosity can be applied to the Greco-Roman world.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-27" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-27" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">27</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Whitehouse’s model has some heuristic value in our present context, as we deal with the religious scene of the late antique Mediterranean and Near East. More precisely, different combinations of the modes of religiosity should lead to different patterns of rationalization, as the reflexivity of religion will be expressed differently in each case. It is important to highlight the fact that modes of religiosity cut through all communities, although in different ways. For a long time scholarship has dealt with exoteric and esoteric trends in all late ancient religious movements: orthodoxy and heresy, priesthood and prophecy, wisdom and prophecy, public and private religion, tradition and revolution, activism and quietism, ritualistic and mystical trends. While such taxonomies are found in highly different milieus, it is essential to note that in each religious tradition, or group of communities, a different equilibrium is found between the two modes of religiosity. As I have already noted, this fact results in different rationalization patterns in each case.</p>
<p class="para">From the start, Christianity gave up on most of the traditional markers of Jewish identity. In the Roman world, Christians had no easily observable identity, and Christian thinkers very soon learned to focus upon the few <span id="page_52"></span>core Christian beliefs, such as the trinity of the one God, and the simultaneity of the divine and the human natures of Jesus Christ. Hence came the imperious need to distinguish true from false beliefs, and the birth of theological polemics, which would confront heterodoxy, or heresy, with orthodoxy. Theologians seek to interpret the scriptures in ways coherent with their own implicit intellectual and religious attitudes and beliefs. Their goal is to provide a global vision of their <i class="calibre1">Weltanschauung</i> devoid, as much as possible, of self-contradictions or even serious tensions. At the same time, however, they seek to inscribe themselves within the tradition of their community, a desire that perforce includes various contradictory statements.</p>
<p class="para">The history of early Christian thought reflects the insoluble tension between these two opposing trends. Some writers, wishing to remain “orthodox” and to retain the bulk of the tradition, insisted on affirming <i class="calibre1">together</i> beliefs contradictory to one another. They argued that thanks to the divine <i class="calibre1">musterion</i>, two affirmations seemingly contradicting one another according to the rules of logic could nonetheless be both true. This thought pattern is quite clearly reflected, in particular, in the great theological debates about Trinitarian and Christological conceptions.</p>
<p class="para">In contradistinction to the mainstream, heretical thinkers opted for intellectual consistency, at the price of giving up on important aspects of the tradition. They made radical choices (the Greek <i class="calibre1">hairesis</i>, a faction, originally means “choice”) between logical possibilities. God is either one or three; He cannot be both. Christ is either divine or human; He cannot be both. Hence, the central use of logic for the heretics (for instance, A is different from non-A), as well as the appeal to what one can call meta-logical arguments among the orthodox. Eunomius (d. 393), for instance, had proposed a radical version of Arianism, according to which God’s unity demanded simplicity (i.e., one person), and only a moral, rather than an essential, similarity between creator and created. In their polemical treatises against him, the Cappadocian fathers (the cousins Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus) reckoned that he had logic on his side when dealing with the doctrine of the Trinity. They therefore resorted to slander, calling him a sophist, a dialectician, and a “technologist,” while referring to <i class="calibre1">musterion</i> in order to establish the orthodox conception of the relationship between Father and Son.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-28" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-28" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">28</sup></a> The Christian rationalization process will focus, then, on the logic of theological discourse.</p>
<p class="para">The transformation of Christianity with the Constantinian revolution and its aftermath brought a new relationship with Judaism, now downgraded to the status of a tolerated religion (actually, almost a heresy), and hence new configurations of religion in the Empire. To some extent, rabbinic Judaism <span id="page_53"></span>became perceived along the lines of official Christianity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-29" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-29" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">29</sup></a> Yet, the structure of rabbinic Judaism is deeply different from that of patristic Christianity. Jewish identity remained protected by kinship rules, strict ritual limitations on permissible foods, and adherence to the Jewish calendar. This entailed a much lighter insistence on forging an orthodox theology than in the case of Christians. No less than patristic literature, the Talmudic tractates, which to a great extent preserve protocols of legal discussions, and which develop biblical hermeneutics established upon clear rules of interpretation (<i class="calibre1">ha-middot she-ha-Torah nidreshet bahen</i>), represent a rationalization process. At the same time, these tractates reflect the estrangement of Judaism from the Hellenistic culture with which it had been in close contact in the previous period. In Talmudic literature, however, legal texts remain irretrievably mixed with oral traditions and legends based upon biblical figures (<i class="calibre1">midrash haggada</i>). This literary phenomenon is strikingly different from anything in patristic literature.</p>
<p class="para">Patristic Christianity and rabbinic Judaism can be perceived as emphasizing two different forms of the doctrinal mode of religiosity, the first written, the second oral. In these two cases, rationalization will follow different patterns. The first pattern of rationalization, which may be called “discursive rationalization,” is reflected, for instance, in the patristic theological and polemical treatises. Rabbinic Judaism, on the other hand, highlights religious praxis while playing down (but not ignoring!) beliefs and dogmas. We may call the pattern of rationalization at work in rabbinic Judaism “ritual rationalization.” The first pattern emphasizes orthodoxy, while religious praxis remains in the background. The second focuses on orthopraxy, often keeping beliefs and dogmas implicit rather than explicit. The first will focus on fighting heresy, while the second will insist on the threat of schisms within the community.</p>
<p class="para">Let us then imagine the two modes of religiosity in action in late antiquity. The dogmatic trend is easily recognizable in the building of both orthodoxy and orthopraxy in the different religious groups. The dogmatic mode of religiosity is reflected in what one can call the late antique scriptural movement. This expression follows a trend from the redaction of the New Testament and the Mishnah, through that of the Manichaean and Mandaean texts, up to that of the Qur’an. The centrality of books in late antique religion is far from limiting itself to canonical books. In late antique Christianity, books of different kinds play a major role: Apocryphal books of the New Testament, apologetic tracts, polemical writings against Jews, heretics, pagans, biblical commentaries, homilies, spiritual texts, etc. The doctrinal mode of religiosity <span id="page_54"></span>finds here a major literary expression, and William Harris has even been able to speak of Christian “logorrhea.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-30" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-30" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">30</sup></a> Writing, however, was not central to all late antique religious traditions. Both rabbinic Jews and Sasanian Zoroastrians, for instance, seem to have been satisfied with their traditional scriptures, and sought to avoid writing other books, preferring a highly sophisticated system of oral traditions. In this context, we must remember that in the ancient world, a book could also remain oral, to be memorized rather than committed to writing: thus the “oral Torah,” that is, the Mishnah, or the Avesta, which remained oral for a thousand years without significant changes, or even the Qur’an, which seems to have been transmitted orally for a short time before reaching its written form.</p>
<p class="para">From the writings of the New Testament to the redaction of the Qur’an, a long list of texts is perceived as revealed, such as the Gnostic, the Manichaean, and the Mandaean scriptures. Others are considered to be endowed with the same legitimacy as that of revealed Scriptures, as for instance the Mishnah and later both the Palestinian and the Babylonian versions of the Talmud, as well as some of the patristic tractates. Such writings have achieved a higher, almost canonical status granted to texts considered to be representatives of Jewish or Christian “mainstream,” orthodox thought. In contradistinction to the new scriptures, this second category of texts essentially reflects hermeneutical efforts within a tradition, rather than a break with earlier tradition and the establishment of a new religious movement. In Jewish literature, one can include in this category, for instance, biblical Targumim and Midrashic collections (both <i class="calibre1">midrash halacha</i> and <i class="calibre1">midrash aggada</i>), where legends, usually about biblical figures, purport to offer interpretations of biblical passages. In patristic literature, genres are more clearly defined: theological treatises, biblical commentaries, homilies, spiritual pamphlets as well as letters. The commentaries written on Plato’s works by Neoplatonist philosophers seem to have played a comparable role among the last communities of pagan philosophers, where they offered a warrant for orthodoxy.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-31" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-31" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">31</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">So far, we have dealt with two different forms of the doctrinal mode of religiosity, as expressed in patristic and in rabbinic literature. Whitehouse’s second, imagistic mode refers to intensive or even ecstatic experiences linked to charismatic personalities. In the religions of the Mediterranean and the Near East, the long ecstatic and charismatic tradition is that of prophecy. The phenomenon was in existence, in different forms, in most religious traditions of the area during much of the first millennium <span class="sc">bce</span> (e.g. the Bacchic maenads and their frenzy) and continued, sometimes under new garbs, in the first millennium <span class="sc">ce</span>. In our context, the second, imagistic mode of religiosity may <span id="page_55"></span>hence be called, in an allusion to the title of Arthur Lovejoy’s seminal book, <i class="calibre1">The Great Chain of Being</i>, “the great chain of prophecy.” Although no one disputes the obvious fact that both Jesus and Muhammad must be understood within the same broad phenomenon continuing the tradition of the biblical prophets, the continuous trend of prophecy throughout late antiquity has not received all the scholarly attention it requires. Prophecy, obviously present in those religious movements originating in the biblical tradition, seems to have been rife also among pagans, as indicated by Lucian of Samosata’s <i class="calibre1">Alexander the False Prophet</i>, a polemical and ironic work, in a rather Voltairian vein, on Alexander of Abonoteichos.</p>
<p class="para">Both in the Greek and in the Hebrew traditions prophecy belongs to religious enthusiasm, in the strong sense of the word, and reflects the total possession of the individual by the divine spirit, being hence endowed with the intensity typical of Whitehouse’s imagistic religiosity. While various religious systems grant a significant place to religious enthusiasm, all seek to limit its autonomous power, even its legitimacy. In Greece, ecstatic cults, such as that of Dionysus, remained marginalized and were never quite integrated into the official cult of the city. The suspicion of the Romans toward religious movements encouraging the expression of subjectivity is well known. In Weberian terms, religious enthusiasm represents the canalization of charisma into a new religious movement, as it grows and develops social structures. Enthusiasm soon enters into a conflicting relationship with ecclesiastical authority, eventually becoming identified with religious deviance, with heresy.</p>
<p class="para">Some of the leading religious figures of the long late antiquity, from Marcus Magus and Montanus in the second century, through Mani in the third, and up to Muhammad, present themselves, each in his turn, as heirs of the prophetic tradition, bringing to an end the great chain of the biblical prophets and its apex in the prophecy of Jesus. For their opponents, the patristic heresiologists, these religious leaders were all impostors, false prophets.</p>
