<p class="parafl">To a great extent, and perhaps more than is usually acknowledged, the early polemic between Christians and Jews had Abraham as one of its main focal points. The rabbis of the Talmud, in stark contradistinction to the church fathers, did not indulge very much in literary polemics against their opponents. While the patristic heresiographers spent endless efforts describing at length the odious beliefs and practices of the heretics before refuting them, the rabbis found it much more expedient simply to ignore them, thus “killing them by silence,” content with vague allusions to the <i class="calibre1">minim</i>, a generic term for heretics of all kinds. It is, then, mainly thanks to patristic literature that we can retrieve the early career of the religious conflict between Christians and Jews about Abraham’s inheritance.</p>
<p class="para">Abraham was not only a main figure of contention between Jews and Christians. Various indicators point to the importance of the figure of Abraham in the Roman Empire, where he seems to have been a well-known and highly respected hero of archaic times. It is no mere chance that Emperor Alexander Severus (208–235 <span class="sc">ce</span>) is claimed to have possessed, together with statues of Orpheus and Apollonius of Tyana, one of Abraham (but no statue of Moses).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-6" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> Emperor Julian himself, arguing against the Christians that, since they claim to be followers of Abraham, they should practice circumcision, adds that he himself reveres the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-7" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a> Marinos, <span id="page_192"></span>Proclus’s successor at the head of the Academy, was born in Neapolis in Samaria (today Nablus). According to his pupil Damascius, there was on Mount Gerizim (the Samaritans’ holiest site) “the most holy shrine of Zeus Hypsistos, founded by Abraham the patriarch of the ancient Hebrews.” Marinos, a Samaritan by birth, converted to paganism, as it were, as he became convinced that Samaritan beliefs had departed from Abraham’s religion.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-8" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a> To be sure, these few texts provide only meager information, but they do point to a continuing presence of the figure of Abraham far beyond the Jewish and Christian communities.</p>
<p class="para">“What has Athens to do with Jerusalem, or the Academy with the Church?”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-9" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> Since Tertullian’s pithy phrase, and despite it, the development of Christian theology in the Roman Empire and beyond has been symbolized by the relationship between Jerusalem and Athens. What the great majority of the early Christian thinkers (especially, of course, those writing in either Greek or Latin) did, and to a great measure successfully, was, precisely, to build bridges between Athens and Jerusalem. Henry Chadwick once used the metaphor of the ellipse in order to describe the relationship between Jerusalem and Rome in the early Church, in order to indicate its dialectical nature.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-10" href="part0023_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-12-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> The same metaphor could certainly be used to describe the circulation of ideas between the young faith in the crucified Jewish Messiah and Greco-Roman culture. To a great extent, the ellipse Athens–Jerusalem can indeed symbolize the major effort of the early Christian theologians from the days of the Apologetes to those of the Cappadocians. As the title of this book points out, I have proposed to highlight here another trajectory, of a different kind, in patristic literature: that which would eventually lead to the foundation of a new religion by the Prophet from the Hijaz.</p>
