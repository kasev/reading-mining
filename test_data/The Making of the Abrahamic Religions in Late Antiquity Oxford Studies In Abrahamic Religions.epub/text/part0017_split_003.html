<p class="parafl">When we speak of communities, we tend to assume that this was the natural mould of religious expression for both Jews and Christians.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-13" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a> But one should avoid isolating these two special groups from the broader context. In the ancient world, religion was above all a matter of state, of public life. The heart of religious cult was public, from Egypt and Babylonia to Rome. The Jerusalem Temple reflected the Israelite version of ancient civic religion (as best expressed in Varro’s conception of <i class="calibre1">religio civilis</i>). After its destruction, Judaism underwent a deep transformation and religion became to a great extent internalized, while religious life was centered upon the synagogue cult and learning the Torah in the community. The early Christians, of course, lived their religious life within communities, as any form of public expression of their faith was prohibited. In adopting Christianity, Constantine thought that the new faith could advantageously replace the old cult of the gods and provide a new civic religion for the Empire. This was a gross miscalculation, of course, as Machiavelli saw so well: Christianity was not really fitted as a civil religion, as it preached another, heavenly, kingdom.</p>
<p class="para">Like Judaism, Christianity was essentially a religion of communities, based upon books.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-14" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> Christian scriptures were translated into various languages, in and outside the Empire. Such a web of communities went against the grain of a <span id="page_109"></span>civic religion that could provide a unification principle for the Empire. Actually, between the fourth and the seventh century, there was a significant, and at points dramatic, decline in economic activity and long-distance communications throughout the Mediterranean. Indices such as naval commerce are directly relevant here. The growth of religious communities in late antiquity, fostered by Judaism and Christianity, is one of the significant but still rather understudied marks of this global decline.</p>
<p class="para">Another characteristic of the Christianized Empire was the new central importance of religion (as distinguished from other aspects of culture) in the perception of identity. Since Hellenistic times, identity had been usually phrased in terms of culture (including religion). Traditional ethnic frameworks of identity had been replaced, to a great extent, by broader horizons. Identity was not anymore necessarily given with birth, but could be chosen. One only needed to speak Greek (or Latin) in order to identify oneself as a member of a society with ecumenical dimensions. Just as one could adopt a culture, one could also convert to a new religion. Conversion had been a recognized possibility since Alexander.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-15" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a> With the victory of Christianity, however, the nature of conversion changed in very significant ways. Unlike other religions in the Roman Empire (including the mystery cults), with the exception of Judaism, Christianity insisted upon truth as a central aspect of religion. Choice now received a consequence unknown elsewhere.</p>
<p class="para">The new insistence on religious identity permitted the development of identity based essentially on community. This new communitarian identity, which too often remains unrecognized, is of crucial importance for the correct understanding of the religious dynamics between Christians and Jews in late antiquity. Indeed, despite the deep differences between minority (the Jews) and majority (the Christians), the relationships between the two groups were based upon their common self-understanding as religious communities. While the religious elites worked on building and maintaining the boundaries of the communities, autonomous and self-enclosed, these boundaries were constantly eroded by daily intercourse.</p>
<p class="para">The radically new status of Christianity in the fourth century was not quite unparalleled in Judaism, in the sense that only then did the rabbinic movement succeed in imposing its view of things on the great majority of Jews. Until then, it seems that the Jewish public was much more amorphous in its beliefs and attitudes than would eventually become the case, often harboring syncretistic beliefs that did not square well with the theology of the rabbis.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-16" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a></p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_110"></span>Some scholars, in particular Jacob Neusner, following Rosemary Ruether, and himself followed by Daniel Boyarin, have noticed that only in the fourth century did Jews and Christians come into possession, for the first time, of clear-cut identities; hence, for Neusner, the historical meeting between Judaism and Christianity occurred in the fourth century.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-17" href="part0017_split_014.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a> To Neusner’s analysis, one should add the contemporary emergence of both Jewish and Christian intellectual culture, the former bilingual in nature (Hebrew and Aramaic, both in Palestine and in Mesopotamia), the latter expressed in a plurality of languages (at least Greek, Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Persian). It is the combination of these two factors that explains the power of the new dynamics between Jews and Christians.</p><span id="acprof-9780198738862-chapter-7-div1-26"></span>
