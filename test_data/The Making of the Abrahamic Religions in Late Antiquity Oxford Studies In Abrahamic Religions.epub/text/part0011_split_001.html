<p class="parafl">In late antiquity, the dynamic contacts between pagan and monotheistic religions, as well as the transformation of religion itself, made a deep impact upon society and culture. The invention of Gnostic and Manichaean mythologies, the growth of the cult of the saints among Christians, and the development of monotheism among pagan intellectuals are only three of the most striking phenomena reflecting this interface. Such trends reflect the existence of what we can call a religious <i class="calibre1">koinē</i>, a shared religious platform, or common denominator to all religious identities, existing side by side with the usually conflicting aspect of inter-religious relations. I propose, tentatively, to refer to this <i class="calibre1">koinē</i> as “late antique religion,” or, if you prefer, “meta-religion.” One of the most striking components of this “meta-religion” is what seems to be the universal growth of magic, a basic religious attitude crossing all traditional and official religious boundaries in the late ancient Mediterranean and Near East. The stupendous number of magical bowls, from all provenances, remains the most striking testimony to this religious <i class="calibre1">koinē</i>, shared not only by the lower tier, but also by the social elites of the different communities.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-1" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-1" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">The relatively new term “rationalization” is polyvalent and not easily defined. Since its appearance in the mid-nineteenth century, it has been mainly used in the context of industry and management, as well as in psychoanalysis. Today, “rationality” commonly appears in the context of game theory as well as in the cognitive sciences. “What is meant by rationality is neither clear nor constant,” notes the French anthropologist Dan Sperber.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-2" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-2" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> In the entry “Rationalisierung” in the wonderful tool that is the <i class="calibre1">Handbuch religionswissenschaftlicher Grundbegriffe</i>, Rudolph Wofgang Müller insists on Max <span id="page_44"></span>Weber’s major contribution to the meaning of the term in twentieth-century sociology.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-3" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-3" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a> In Weberian parlance, <i class="calibre1">Rationalisierung</i> refers to the progressive mastery of man upon earth, and to what Weber called <i class="calibre1">Entzauberung der Welt</i>, “disenchantment of the world.” For Weber, rationalization means “the knowledge or belief that if one but wished one could learn it at any time. Hence, it means that principally there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. This means that the world is disenchanted.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-4" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-4" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Processes of rationalization reflect the conscious, reflexive effort to bring more rationality to a religious tradition, to a set of rituals or beliefs. While rationalization entails a relationship between religion and reason, it mainly emphasizes a process: religions are susceptible, in time, to developing a more rational argumentation, both in polemics (either internal or external) and in reflection about themselves. Rationalization, then, is a reflexive process. But it seems to be a collective process rather than the intellectual activity of individual thinkers.</p>
<p class="para">One could, of course, simplify the topic a bit by proposing a reflection on the constant tension between “faith and reason,” to follow the traditional problem in Christian theology from the patristic period to medieval scholasticism, and beyond. One could also analyze “rationalist” theological trends in a given religious tradition and/or during a certain period. Another approach would focus on the dialectic relationship between two (or three) of the “Abrahamic religions” at a particular polemical moment. But “rationalization in religion” does not simply mean the ways in which religion integrates rational discussion of its beliefs. According to Sperber, rationality “implies a certain degree of consistency between beliefs and experience and among beliefs. Rationality, then, presupposes cognitive mechanisms which tend to prevent or to eliminate empirical inconsistencies and logical contradictions.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-5" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-5" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Speaking of rationalization in religion involves a number of implicit claims, which one should try to make explicit. First, religion is perceived as an attempt to understand the world, offering solutions to perennial, basic fears. For such a conception, religion is a kind of explanatory or etiological thinking. Myths are the first expression of these solutions, which are later recast in philosophical hermeneutics. We are dealing here with an intellectualist conception of religion, even when etiological thinking is expressed only in ritual, rather than in discourse. This is the case, in particular, of preliterate societies. Hence, we may say that <span id="page_45"></span>rationalization in religion, a phenomenon reflexive by nature, and already present in mythological thought patterns, reflects religion thinking about itself, transforming symbolic and mythological thought into either discursive thought or ritual praxis.</p>
<p class="para">In order to understand what rationalization means in the context of religious history, it may be useful to go back to Max Weber’s theory of development of reason throughout Western civilization. For Weber, as is well known, the most striking “disenchantment of the world” in history occurred with the rise of the “inner-worldly” asceticism (<i class="calibre1">innerweltliche Askese</i>) of the Calvinist Reformation. And yet, it can be argued that also in earlier periods, one can witness religious transformations, even mutations, which may also be described in similar terms. Sadly, Weber did not have the opportunity to work on early Christianity. Had he been given the time to do so, he might well have described the rejection of the Gnostic <i class="calibre1">Weltanschauung</i> by the church fathers of late antiquity as a clear case of “disenchantment.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-6" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-6" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> For the sake of brevity, I ignore here the various (and often rather otiose) recent objections to the very concept of Gnosticism. The Gnostic movement in the early Roman Empire represented a broader religious trend, or spectrum, than what we usually refer to as a sect. Yet, it remained diffuse, without becoming a full-fledged religion, and seems to have worked its way, mainly, as a radicalization of the dualist tendency inherent to the earliest strata of Christianity. To a great extent, the various Gnostic solutions to the problem of evil were based upon a return to mythic modes of thought, appealing to patterns inherited from apocryphal Jewish literature as well as from Greek mythological traditions.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-7" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-7" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">7</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Both Gnostics and Manichaeans sought in their different ways (the latter as a world church established on strongly dualistic patterns) to offer a response to the question of the origin of evil (<i class="calibre1">Unde malum?</i>), a question which was particularly acute within a monotheistic milieu, in which the ultimate responsibility of the Demiurge for evil increased the urgency of a theodicy. Doing so, the dualist thinkers claimed to offer a return to a rigorously structured system, in a sense a “rationalization” of religion, which insisted on salvific knowledge (<i class="calibre1">gnōsis</i>), rather than on faith (<i class="calibre1">pistis</i>). The tension between <i class="calibre1">gnōsis</i> and <i class="calibre1">pistis</i> is also found in a Christian “orthodox,” or mainstream theologian such as Clement of Alexandria, but for him there is a clear passage from the former to the latter.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-8" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-8" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">8</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">In contradistinction to Clement’s approach, the dualist systems put the two terms, <i class="calibre1">pistis</i> and <i class="calibre1">gnōsis</i>, into dramatic opposition: the Gnostics, “those who <span id="page_46"></span>know,” being ontologically different from all other human beings, who are either servants of the lower demiurge, condemned to damnation, or, at best, “simple Christians,” believers in a cause they do not really understand. To be sure, many among the Gnostic dualists appealed to Greek philosophical traditions, and were deemed heretics by orthodox thinkers precisely because they followed pagan philosophers, although the use of reason by Gnostic theologians seems to be quite different from that of philosophers.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-9" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-9" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">9</sup></a> Dualist gnosis does not usually refer to a positive, demonstrable knowledge endowed with epistemic content. Rather, this gnosis is essentially esoteric, and is endowed with a saving value. Gnosis refers here to the secret myths explaining the universe. The Gnostics, just like the participants in the Greek mysteries, are the recipients of secret knowledge on the origins and the nature of both the cosmos and humans.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-10" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-10" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">10</sup></a> This secret knowledge is actually endowed with a direct soteriological power. Unlike all other human beings, the Gnostics (or the “true” Manichaeans, the community’s ascetic, monastic core—those whom Augustine would call <i class="calibre1">electi</i>) will thus be saved. It is this claim of an esoteric knowledge about God and the cosmos that was rejected by the church fathers as preposterous.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-11" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-11" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">11</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Referring to Augustine’s polemics against the Manichaeism of his youth, the French philosopher Paul Ricœur has described Manichaean mythology as “a simulacrum of reason.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-12" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> The multiple levels of reality, the complex structure of Manichaean cosmogony and cosmology, anthropogony, and anthropology, as well as eschatology of both the soul and the world’s structure, all acted as a sophisticated scaffolding of sorts, supporting the world, and giving the misleading impression of rationality. But in fact, Manichaeism represented a flight into an unbridled, Gothic mythology attracting intellectually inclined spirits. It may well be that it is precisely its rigorous geometry (two powers, three times, pentads of divine hypostases, etc.) and its abstract character which prevented many from becoming captivated by the radical alternative of Manichaeism in late antiquity and beyond. It is indeed to Greek mythological thinking, rather than to Greek rational thinking, that Gnosticism was appealing.</p>
<p class="para"><span id="page_47"></span>Hence, Harnack’s famous dictum, according to which Gnosticism was “the acute Hellenization of Christianity” (die akute Hellenisierung des Christentums), represents only a part of a historical perception of the phenomenon.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-13" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a> What is certain is that the eventual Christian rejection of Gnosticism reflected a denial of those mythological overgrowths, as well as the reaffirmation of a theology emphasizing not only God’s unity, but also His incarnation. It also positioned ethics at the very core of religion. In this sense, one may speak of a process of “disenchantment of the world” in action in late antiquity in general, and in early Christianity in particular.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-14" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> The rejection of the radical Hellenization of Gnosis, therefore, might legitimately be perceived as both a case of “disenchantment of the world,” and a process of rationalization of religion. Gnosis may well have represented the Hellenization of Christianity, but it certainly did not represent its rationalization. I wish to insist on this fact, which highlights the chasm between the Hellenization of Christianity and its rationalization, two contemporary but profoundly different processes.</p>
<p class="para">It is the church fathers, then, rather than the dualist or Gnostic thinkers, who offered in late antiquity a “rationalization” of religion. This may sound counterintuitive, as “reason” is usually perceived as the prerogative of philosophers in the ancient world, while the earliest Christian intellectuals, the second-century apologetic fathers, had spent much of their energy rebutting pagan accusations of irrationality. For a long time, Hellenic intellectuals, such as Celsus or Alexander of Lycopolis, considered Christians as weak on metaphysics, even when they did recognize their impressive ethical behavior—for instance their courage in the face of persecution.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-15" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a> When Tertullian, at the turn of the third century, rhetorically asked whether there was anything that “Athens” shared with “Jerusalem,” he was not juxtaposing Athena and Christ, <span id="page_48"></span>but rather Socrates and Jesus.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-16" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a> Faith in the incarnated revelation was for him incommensurable with Greek philosophy, rather than with Greek religion. As we know, his approach remained a minority position in late antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages, as most Christian writers sought to find an accommodation between what they considered to be “the best parts” of Greek thought (usually a combination of Platonic ontology and Stoic ethics) and their own scriptural tradition. While Tertullian’s fideism never made it into the mainstream of Christian thought, it never quite disappeared, and has remained a constant temptation, or rather a pole of attraction, for a number of significant thinkers, from Pascal to Kierkegaard. In a sense, Luther’s appeal to <i class="calibre1">sola scriptura</i>, rejecting the long tradition of Scholastic hermeneutics, reflected a return to the fideist attitude first heralded by Tertullian. The perennial tension between the intellectualist and the fideist poles in Christian thought is traditionally expressed in the relationship between faith and reason in European intellectual history.</p>
<p class="para">In his recent book, <i class="calibre1">Hellenisierung des Christentums</i>, Christoph Markschies has offered a thorough reflection on “Hellenization” as referring to the transformation processes in early Christianity and on the history of its use.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-17" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a> To pursue Markschies’s reflection, one could point out that the marriage of Christian thought and Greek philosophy was the direct inheritor of the long flirtation of Jewish thinkers from Alexandria up to Philo, Paul’s contemporary, with Hellenistic philosophy.</p>
<p class="para">The transformation of religion in this period is also, <i class="calibre1">ipso facto</i>, the transformation of philosophy. While Christian faith sought very early to express itself through Greek concepts, Greco-Roman philosophers learned to focus on questions crucial for religion, even developing a need for Holy Scriptures, in imitation of the Christians. As we now know, far from remaining the privilege of Jews and Christians, monotheism developed in the Roman Empire also among pagan philosophers. Indeed, as Polymnia Athanassiadi puts it, in late antiquity “monotheism was becoming the politically correct religious idiom” <a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-18" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a> and the ascetical way of life typical of philosophers seems to have been quite <span id="page_49"></span>close, at least structurally, to Christian asceticism. The “Neo-Hellenic” return to the gods of old by some Neoplatonic philosophers, a phenomenon that paradoxically owes much to the despised religion of the “Galileans,” represents to some extent a reaction to the fascination with monotheism. Such an attitude represented a turn of philosophy to religion, parallel to the Christian appropriation of Platonic thought patterns. The close contacts between religion and philosophy in the Roman world, then, should not only be perceived as <i class="calibre1">Rationalisierung der Religion</i>. They may as well be described as “derationalization of philosophy” (<i class="calibre1">Entrationalisierung der Philosophie</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-19" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a> Particularly helpful in understanding the transformation of philosophical life are both the Weberian concept of “forms of life” (<i class="calibre1">Lebensformen</i>) and Hadot’s analysis of the ancient philosophical way of life, in particular the “spiritual exercises” cherished by the late Greek philosophers, and later identified with trends in Christian spirituality.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-20" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> Under the Empire, asceticism and the quest for a pure life ultimately seeking unification with the divine belong to the zeitgeist.</p>
<p class="para">We can see how complex things are: rationalization of religion is not quite the same thing as either Hellenization of thought or “disenchantment of the world”—and yet, there exist clear overlaps between these concepts. Eastern Christian writers retained, from the early centuries to the end of Byzantium, a deep ambivalence to their very language, Greek. In Christian parlance, “Hellenes” had only one meaning: “pagans.” Christians, even when Greek was both their spoken and written language, never forgot the essential pagan character of that language. Only towards a few Greek philosophers (essentially Plato) did the church fathers seek to develop a different attitude. For Justin Martyr, in the first half of the second century, Plato’s noble doctrines reflected God’s decision to implant seeds of truth, before Christ’s coming, among all nations. Justin develops the idea of a <i class="calibre1">logos spermatikos</i>, a concept he borrows from Stoic philosophy, where it refers to the generative principle of the universe. It would eventually be accepted by most Christian theologians, at least implicitly, permitting them to salvage Plato from the abyss of perdition where most pagans belonged.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-21" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> This did not prevent Christian authors, however, from highlighting the deep rift between even the best among the Greek philosophical schools and their own school of wisdom, which, they insisted, remained essentially different from (and of course better than) all the schools of Greek (i.e., pagan) philosophy.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, Tertullian remarks that in many cases, the pagan Seneca writes just as if he were a Christian: <i class="calibre1">Seneca saepe noster</i>—Seneca, who often sounds <span id="page_50"></span>like one of us (i.e., a Christian).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-22" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a> The same Tertullian also develops the idea that the soul is Christian by nature: <i class="calibre1">anima naturaliter Christiana</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-23" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a> In other words, these two references show that, even for Tertullian, the chasm between Christianity and pagan thought is not absolute, and revelation retains some deep similarities with the best among the pagan philosophers.</p>
<p class="para">Christian teachers presented themselves as belonging to a new school of philosophy, better than those of the “Hellenes.” For Theodoret of Cyrrhus, a fifth-century theologian and church historian, <i class="calibre1">philosophia</i> would refer to the monastic way of life. In a sentence that sounds like a precursor of Marx’s famous dictum, Theodoret pointed out that while Greek philosophers sought to understand the world, the monks intended to transform it. The radical semantic transformation of <i class="calibre1">philosophia</i> reflects the limits of Christian Hellenization.</p>
<p class="para">What I have called the late antique “disenchantment of the world” did not quite entail giving up on all mythology. Neither monotheisms nor dualisms are devoid of mythological thought patterns. Rather, the drastic limitation of the number of divine beings entailed a radical simplification of mythical structures, when all angels had become God’s hosts, and all demons Satan’s helpers. The Neoplatonist philosophers were able to develop a hermeneutics based upon some of the traditional Greek myths, mainly as told in the Homeric epics.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-24" href="part0011_split_002.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-3-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> Yet, religions having both ethics and history (more precisely history of salvation, <i class="calibre1">Heilsgeschichte</i>) at their core could develop rationalizing hermeneutics more naturally than philosophical systems.</p>
