<p class="parafl">The religious vocabulary of the Near East in the first Christian centuries retains a broad spectrum of senses for both the noun “seal” and the verb “to seal.” As a matter of fact, both the straightforward and the figurative senses already appear in the Hebrew Bible. For the proper sense, one might see in particular Est. 8: 8–10 for the noun, or Jer. 32: 10 for the verb. For the figurative use, see, for instance, Cant. 8: 6 (“Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm”). For our present interest, see especially Hag. 2: 23, where God says to Zerubbabel, whom He calls His servant, that He will make him “like a <i class="calibre1">ḥotam</i>” (signet ring?), for He has chosen him. More precisely, even, in Dan. 9: 24, we read: “Seventy weeks of years are decreed concerning your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin (<i class="calibre1">ve-laḥtom ḥata’ot</i>), and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet (<i class="calibre1">ve-laḥtom ḥazon u-navi</i>), and to anoint a most holy place.” It must be noted that the root <i class="calibre1">ḥtm</i> is used in its two senses in this last verse: to end (the first time) and to accomplish (the second time).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-12" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-12" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">12</sup></a> A brief investigation did not reveal any particular interest in the words <i class="calibre1">ve- laḥtom ḥazon u-navi</i> in either rabbinic or Christian exegesis.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-13" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-13" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">13</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">These same uses of the noun and the verb reappear in the New Testament. While a verse like Rev. 5: 1 obviously reflects the literal sense of a seal (on a letter), the figurative meaning appears too: in John 3: 33 it can only mean “to confirm,” while in 2 Cor. 1: 22 Paul implies that, in sealing believers, God has made them His inviolable possession. Paul also reflects Jewish religious parlance when he says that Abraham “received the sign (<i class="calibre1">sēmeion</i>) of circumcision as a seal (<i class="calibre1">sphragis</i>) of the righteousness of the faith” (Rom. 4: 11). Indeed, circumcision is often called a <i class="calibre1">seal</i> in rabbinic literature: <i class="calibre1">Exodus Rabba</i>, for instance, speaks of “the seal of Abraham in your flesh,” <i class="calibre1">ḥotam Abraham bi-besarekha</i>.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-14" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-14" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">14</sup></a> The same use is found in apostolic literature (for instance in <i class="calibre1">Barnabas</i> 9: 6), where <i class="calibre1">sphragis</i> obviously means “attestation” or “confirmation.” From Jewish circumcision, however, the term came to refer primarily to baptism in early Christianity. The <i class="calibre1">Shepherd of Hermas</i> (<i class="calibre1">Simil</i>. <span id="page_91"></span>IX. 16.3 17.4 and parallels) and the <i class="calibre1">2nd Letter of Clement</i> (7.6; 8.6), preserve the earliest use of this label for baptism. In these writings, to receive the seal means to receive the name of God, to be granted life.</p>
<p class="para">The <i class="calibre1">Shepherd of Hermas</i>, in particular, refers to those who have received the “seal of the Son of God,” adding that the sealing is the water of baptism (<i class="calibre1">hē sphragis oun to hudōr estin</i>).<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-15" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">15</sup></a> As Bousset, after Dölger, noted long ago, “the uttering of the name is probably only a weakened sacramental form for the more original, more robust custom of branding or etching upon the person being initiated the sign (name, symbol) of the appropriate God, to whom it was consecrated.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-16" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a> A similar metaphorical use of <i class="calibre1">seal</i> is to be found in various Gnostic texts, although an actual baptism with water might not be implied in all cases.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-17" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">Among the Mandaeans, <i class="calibre1">sealing</i> (<i class="calibre1">ḥatamta</i>), which protects against demons and evil powers, seems to be part of the baptismal ritual.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-18" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a> The cultic reference to <i class="calibre1">ḥatamta</i> in the Mandaean texts is particularly relevant for our purpose, since the Baptist Elchasaite community in which Mani grew up—and whose beliefs and religious practices he first attempted to reform, before openly and totally rebelling against them—was probably closely related to the Mandaean community and to other Gnostic Baptist groups of Jewish-Christian descent.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-19" href="part0015_split_004.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-6-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a></p>
