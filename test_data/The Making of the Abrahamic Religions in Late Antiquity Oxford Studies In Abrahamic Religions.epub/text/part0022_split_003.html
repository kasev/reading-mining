<p class="parafl">In the fourth century, “pagan” intellectuals, realizing the balance of power had shifted in a dramatic fashion, learned to recognize the virtues of religious pluralism and developed new arguments in favour of religious toleration. Symmachus, in his <i class="calibre1">Relation</i> 8, puts it thus:</p><div class="displaytext">
<p class="quote">Everyone has his own custom and his own rite; the divine mind has allotted a variety of religions to the city as its guardians. As different souls are distributed to the newborn, so are different spirits of destiny to each people.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-15" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-15" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre5">15</sup></a></p></div>
<p class="parafl">Of particular import, in this context, is what one might call the privatization of religion. With the growing numbers of conversions to Christianity, it was inevitable that pluralism would become established in the Empire. At issue was a new reality that had to be recognized. Themistius, another great pagan intellectual of the generation of Emperor Julian, proposes a division into three ethnic groups, or rather, three cultural and religious domains: Greece, homeland of polytheistic Hellenism; Syria, homeland of the Jews and thus also <span id="page_181"></span>representing the Christians; and Egypt, symbolic homeland of the mystical religions.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-16" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-16" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">16</sup></a> As Gilbert Dagron notes in an important study, “the assimilation of major religious concepts into the major provinces of the empire has a … philosophical significance: it reduces the problem of rival religions to a problem of vicinity and concurrent civilizations.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-17" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-17" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">17</sup></a></p>
<p class="para">An analogous tripartition is found in Eusebius, between Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Hellenes.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-18" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-18" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">18</sup></a> With Themistius, the Syrians (alias the Christians) have replaced the Phoenicians: ethnic division has taken on a religious coloration. Indeed, Jews were often regarded by Greek philosophers (such as Porphyry, for instance, who reflects a long tradition) as having been the Syrians’ intellectual and religious elite, their philosophers (just as the Brahmins represented the Indian elite). We should note the importance, in such a context, of the fact that Christianity, like Judaism, was regarded as stemming from the East.</p>
<p class="para">For our purpose, it is important to observe the new manner in which relations between ethnic and religious identities were formulated in the Byzantine Empire.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-19" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-19" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">19</sup></a> From the fourth century and at least up to the eleventh, when Byzantine military victories led to the absorption of sizable Muslim populations into the empire, there was an approximate equivalence between religious and political identity; until that time it was not possible to be Roman without being Christian. For the first Byzantines were also Romans—“Romans of old stock,” <i class="calibre1">katharoi Rōmaioi</i>—who were directly concerned with the welfare of the Empire. And they knew the barbarians were at the gates: the Huns, sowing panic in the Near East at the beginning of the fifth century; later the Bulgars and the Slavs from the Balkans, and, above all, the Muslims—Arabs at first, and then, from the eleventh century, Turks. These were long-term confrontations that would be indelibly imprinted on Byzantine consciousness. As Hélène Ahrweiler has shown, the blend of fear and contempt that the barbarian nomads provoked among the Byzantines resonated as the very definition of “quintessential cultural alterity.”<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-20" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-20" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">20</sup></a> The Byzantines, who saw themselves as both the chosen people and as the <i class="calibre1">Kulturvolk</i> par excellence, drew a radical <span id="page_182"></span>distinction between Christians and non-Christians. In this context two interesting and related concepts may be noted: <i class="calibre1">mixobarbaros</i>, semi-barbarian, and <i class="calibre1">mixellēn</i>, semi-pagan. These curious terms, found in the eleventh century on the Balkan borders in particular, were already in existence in late antiquity. Dioscoros, for instance, in the sixth century, refers to a strange person living on the margins of the known world, mixing with pagans, but also representing a <i class="calibre1">Naturvolk</i> (i.e., a “primitive” people, ignorant of culture), though his purpose is to convert them to Christianity.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-21" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-21" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">21</sup></a> The Byzantines, however, like the Greeks and Romans before them, knew how to distinguish—in the case of peoples foreign to their cultural universe—between <i class="calibre1">Naturvölker</i> and <i class="calibre1">Kulturvölker</i>. From ancient times, the cultural links between the Greeks and the peoples of the Near East had given rise to a long tradition of attraction to the peoples of the East and their “barbarian” wisdom. Thus Indians, for example, though not Arabs, were perceived as a <i class="calibre1">Kulturvolk</i>, with a cultural tradition deemed to be rich, even though there was virtually no knowledge of its substance and the books in which this wisdom was expressed could not be read. Moreover, it seems that the Christian perception of Indians and their culture was not much different from the views found in Greek and Latin pagan texts.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-22" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-22" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">22</sup></a></p>
<div class="lista">
<div class="list1">
<div class="item1a">Let us summarize what we have uncovered so far about the complex interface between the two highly different ethnological taxonomies through which Christians perceived identity. The superposition of these taxonomies in early Byzantium meant that, for Christianized Romans, the concept of “barbarian” had connotations that were distinctly negative politically and culturally, but positive with respect to religion.</div>
<div class="item1a">As believers in Jesus Christ, they confronted the Jews.</div>
<div class="item1a">As [the true] Israel, they confronted the pagans, or <i class="calibre1">hellēnes</i>.</div>
<div class="item1a">As followers of a ‘barbarian wisdom’, they confronted the Greeks.</div>
<div class="item1a">As Romans, they confronted the barbarians.</div></div></div>
<p class="parafl"><i class="calibre1">Barbaros</i> was originally a linguistic term that Hellenistic Jews, and subsequently Christians, had used for their self-representation. We have seen how it retained its original meaning in Byzantium, while, side-by-side with its Christian, positive meaning, it also referred to pagan peoples beyond the confines of the Empire. From the fourth to the seventh centuries, the Christianization of <span id="page_183"></span>the Arabs, both in Syrian towns and among the tribes, seems to have curtailed any ethnological interest in them. Although they remained marginal on account of their language and culture, they underwent a process of integration into the Empire and the Arab kingdoms, whether or not Christian, functioned as “buffer” territories vis-à-vis the Sasanian enemy.</p>
<p class="para">The Byzantine Empire, then, defined itself through Christian Orthodoxy, which entailed the rejection of religious factions which did not receive imperial support, such as Arians and Monophysites, as heretics. Heresy was forbidden by imperial decree, just like the cult of pagan gods, a fact reflected, in particular, in book xvi of the Theodosian Code.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-23" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-23" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">23</sup></a> If the followers of the Monophysite Churches were not actively harried, it was above all because there was no way of eradicating a Christian movement that dominated a good part of the Near East. It has been suggested—a hypothesis that cannot be demonstrated, but which is by no means absurd—that the Byzantines were relieved when the Arabs conquered a good part of the imperial territories in the seventh century and that, to some extent, they even welcomed the conquest.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-24" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-24" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">24</sup></a> From the end of the fourth century, and more markedly from the time of Justinian on, the Jews lost many of their civil rights and became marginalized in a society that defined itself as Christian. Yet, they preserved the right to an existence that, although precarious, was a recognized fact. It should be emphasized that the Jews were the only legally sanctioned religious minority in the Empire. Indeed, under Justinian unity of worship made unity of the Empire a direct function of religious unity, a fact which enabled the emperor to turn religious heresy into political contamination.<a id="r_acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-25" href="part0022_split_005.html#acprof-9780198738862-chapter-11-note-25" class="calibre3"><sup class="calibre4">25</sup></a> In practice, Justinian’s religious policy compelled the Jews to define themselves as a community along the lines of the Christian orthodox model.</p>
